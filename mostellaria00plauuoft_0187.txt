PAGB 45] Ι ΑοΤ 1v. SCENE 2. 135

878. quod: see note 011 747. gestis aliquo: cf. the locution
‘the dog wants out' ; on aliquo, see §50. 2, and cf. Rud. 535, quid si
me aliquo . . . locem, ‘suppose I hire myself out.' mula: the hog
is our ‘glutton' among the animals. In Eupolis, 434, a glutton is
called ὄνου γνάθος, ‘ jaw of an ass' (cf. in Leutsch's Corpus, Diogeniae
nus, Vi. 100, ὄνου ’γνάθοςε εἰς πολυφάγον), While Philemon (188) writes,
ὄνος βαδίζεις εἰς ἄχυρα τραγημάτων, ⁶ ass, thou trudgest to a chaff-heap —-
of daintieS.' The proverb ὄνος εἰς ἀχυρῶνα ἀπέδρα (cf. the Scholiast to
Aristophanes, Vespae, 1310), ‘the ass ran off to the chaff-heap,' is
applied by Apostolius (xii. 78 111 Leutsch's Corpus) ‘to those that
unexpectedly fall into good fortune and agreeably profit therefrom.’

879. bene merens = merito. hoc preti: this prize. inde
= ab eis (cf. 550. 1).

881. die crastini: for the case, see §61. 5, and cf. Men. 1156, die
septimi, ‘ to-day week.'

882. bubulis exuuiis ε highfalutin (cf. §4) for rawhz‘de.

883. postremo: summing up, as in 198.

884. bucaedae: also in the highfalutin style3 bucaedae is glossed
by qui boues caedunt, and should therefore mean either ‘ butchers ' or
‘ox-whippers.’ As the ox-whippers (bubulci, see note on 53) were
country slaves, bucaedae, taken rather literally‚ would imply banish-
ment 10 1116 country (see note on 17). Inasmuch, however, as epithets
are very frequently (see notes on 1, 8, 55, 610.) ‘desiderative’ in
sense, so bucaedae may be defined by ‘requiring the services of the
ox-whipper,’ ‘in need 01 a horse-whipping,’ as we might say.
restio: render similarly by requiriny the rope. Sonnenschein makes
a neat rendering of bucaedae erunt, ‘ they shall go in for tanning.’

ACT IV. 'SCENE 2. —VERSES 885-903.

(1) CnAnAcrEns. -In this scene a second slave of Callidamates is
introduced, named Pinacium. He comes out to join Phaniscus in
fetching their master home.

(2) Svnorms Am> Comama—The matter of this scene consists oi
low and vulgar chaffing between 1116 two slaves. It has 110 bearing
011 1116 development of the play, but merely furnishes an interval
of farce. There is absolutely no sincerity in the remarks of these
slaves, as is clear from quaeso hercle abstine 1 iam sermonem de istis
rebus, ‘and now, I beg you, stop your fooling ’ (897-8983 see also
