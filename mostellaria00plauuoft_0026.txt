21. Iambio. —The unit of measure is not one iambus, but the
Greek measure of two iambios (the monometer). The use in dia-
logue of the senarius, an imitation of the dactylio hexameter, brought
with it the caesural division of the senarius into groups of 2} -ιε 33
iambics‚ and vice versa. These groups are also introduced into song
parta just as the song-colon of 4 iambic measures is occasionally
found in the dialogue3 see §14 (11).

(1) 2} iambicis .·

1) Forming the close of a verse after 2 bacchiacs (ξ 30. 2) 3 not
very unoommon.

tameter3 very uncommon.
