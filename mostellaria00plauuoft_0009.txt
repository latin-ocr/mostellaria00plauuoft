PREFACE.

ΤΗΕ present edition of the Mostellaria has been printed
from the text of Goetz and Schoell's editio minor of PlautuS,
but 111 not a few cases the manuscript readings have been
restored and interpreted‚ 01 conjectures that seemed closer
to the manuscript readings admitted.

In matters of interpretation, obligation is thankfully
acknowledged to the special editions of the Mostellaria
made by Sonnenscliein and Lorenz; to the commentary of
Ussing3 and to the notes of the critical editions of Schoell
and Le0.

The editor alone is responsible for the attempt to fix
anew the significance of the names of some of the charac-
tem, and thence to dei-ive hints for the verbal interpreta-

points involved will be published, it is hoped, at an early
date, in The American Journal os Philologyy.

the metrical and grammatical matters contained 111 the
Introduction. If this gives them a forbidding aspect, there

the Notes. These renderings are not designed as a con-

struing ‘crib' for thc student, but seek above all to catch
