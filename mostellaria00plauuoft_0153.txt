(2) Mn‘rsss.—Ve1·ses 348-406 are in trochaic septenarii (recitative),
ξς 18-19.

348. summis . . . industriis: with all his miyht and maim· in-
dustriis is plural in this phrase, by association with opibus ,· cf. Taminy
os the Shrew, 111. ii. 232, “She is my goods, my cliattels.'’ How-
ever, the plural may have an element of exaggeration in it, as pacibus
perfectis has in Persa, 753.

349. perisse: hardly an example of a genuine perfect infinitive
active with a verb of desiring‚—though this might stand in a legal
passage in the archaic style,—but rather the exclamatory perfect
(ᾖ 71. 2) periit in the infinitive. erilem: see note on 3.

350. occidit: the exclamatory perfect iu the third person. sta-
bulumst: it is doubtful whether the case after stabulumst is an
adnominal dative (ἓ 62. 3; cf. Capi. 523, nec confidentiae usquam
hospitiumsi nee deuoriiculum dolis ‚· also Cicero, (le imp. Pomp. 70,
praesidia periculis aut adiumenta honoribus), or a genitive (cf. Truc.
587, stabulum flayili; Persa, 418, stabulum seruicricium; Trin. 553,
hospiciumst calamitatis).

35].. Salus . . . saluti: for the repetition, see ἓ 79. 8. The
hyperbole was a favorite one 3 cf. Cape. 529, neque iam Salus seruare,
si uolt, potesl,· also Terence, Adelph. 761 ; Cicero, pro Font. 10, 21 ;
Verr. ii. 3. 131. si cupiat: should she clesire; contrasting the mood
with si uolt'in the example just cited, it is hard to draw a distinction.

352. ita: introduces a coordinate clause (5 74. 3); note the allitera-
tion and the vigor of the metaphor. modo ε as in 334.

353. peregre: for the various local relations this adverb may
express, see §652 3.

354. facere lucri: for the idiom, see §GL 2.

355. meam uicem: in my place ,· for uicem, see the grammars.
possit pati: a favorite formula, twice (Persa, 30, Trin. 352) in the
more alliterative and more archaic (see note on 256) ¹form poce pati.

356. isti plagipatidae, ferritribaces: some shaclcled son-os-a-
yun ,⁰ this rendering suggests at least the sense of one of the hybrid
epithets (ς 42). isti ε see note on 274.

357. isti: probably an allusion to the boasting soldier type, Mr.
Dooley’s “patmus'' hosticas: poetical for hostilis, cf. ciuicas
