xxxviii INTRODUCTION. [5 64

us how quam, ‘as,’ which was originally employed with tam to ex-
press comparison of equality, passed subsequently to the sense of
‘ than’ in comparison of inequality. ·

(5) The Ablative absolute enJ'oys only a narrow range in Plautus :v
typical are me uiuo, me apsente (230, 1016). ’

65. ἝοοεΙ Relations. —-l) Perfectly normal are domi, domum,
domo ‚· ruri, ‘on the farm’5 rus, ‘to the farm'3 rure, ‘from the
farm.’ Plautus also has the locative phrase proxumae uiciniae, ‘in
the neighborhood’ (cf. 1062, proxuma uicinia, ‘from hard by’).
2) For town names the rule is that all plural town names as well as
Carthaqo, Capua, Tarentum, omit the preposition in all local relations 3
the locative only is used of all singular nouns of lst, 2d, 3d declen·
sions (except in Alide, Captivi, 926, etc.): for place to and from

which, with all place names not mentioned already, prepositions are ‘

used promiscuously: 66, in Piraeum, but 440, Aeyypto ‚· 499, -Ache-
runcem. 3) Certain adverbs express a variety of local relations ε pereqre,
‘ abroad,' is used with verbs of departing (25), arriving (374), [and abid-
ing] ; intus with verbs of [entering], tarrying (394, 402), and· leaving
(401).

iii. The Moods.

THE INDICATIVE.

66. (1) In deliberative questionS, e.g. quid eqo ago nam (368); see
note on 774 for further examples.

(2) Osten in what later usage1 treats as indirect questions; range
of usage indicated by the following examples: quis id fecit. cedo (478) ;
uide nam moratur (614); uide ut fastidit (886) 3 specta quam dormi-
unt (829); aspice ut accubat (855); scire expeto quod illuc argen-
tumst (626). The subjunctive is, however, by no means excluded
for certain types, eg. uides quae sim, 199 (cf. 837, 969).

(3) Indicative with potential implication ε vix confirmor (see note on
203); ci. aedificantur (117), ‘has to be built.' The independent sub-
junctive also calls for a potential translation occasionally: nescias
(278), ‘one doesn’t know, can't tell'; cf. ut uideas (243), ‘I'd have
you see,' whence, ‘ you can see,'

1 There are traces of the Plautine usage in later authors, e.g. uiden
ut stant cristae (Aeneia, vi. 779, cf. also ib. 771, and 615, with Lade·
wig’s note, citing de Amicitia, 96).
