lacrum = the later ambulatio ‚· perhaps it is best to take ambulacrum
et porticus as a hendiadys, ‘ veranda for promenading.'

757. quid rei coneomniauit: cf. 1013, quid somnias; Rud. 487,
si . . . quid rei commiscuit.

758. quantum potest = quam celerrime ‚· cf. 1101, and 527 (quau-
tum quis).

759. ad eam rem: with a view to this (cf. ᾖ 80).

760. architectonem: the flexional syllable ὄη has its Greek
quantity ; cf. note on 560.

761. exaedificatae insanum bene: awsully well built ,· cf. Miles,
24, epityrum estur insanum bene, ‘ I’m ravenously fond of olive-sauce ’ ;
Prin. 673, insanumst malum. But Bacch. 761, insanum maynum
molior neyotium, and 908 below, are, like this verse, builders' expres-

, sions, while Cicero, Mil. 53, speaks of a thousand workmen being

 

employed on (propter) insanas illas substructiones (cf. Auci. Her.
iv. 63). These passages suggest that insanum conveyed a notion some-
thing like the English word, ‘folly,' as defined by De Quincey in his
essay on Keats: ‘⁶ We have in this country a word, namely, Folly,
. which has a technical appropriation to this case of fantastic build-
ings.” ⁴ Folly ’ in a somewhat similar sense still has a colloquial vogue.

766. quom: concessive, but. with the indicative (ξ 66. 4). usque-
quaque: everywhere else ,· cf. usquam, ‘ anywhere,’ and note the
triple reiteration of usque in slightly different senses.

768. quasi: see note on 277. flagitator: a clun ‚· at Rome a dun
must keep to the forum (cf. Cas. 24, Pseud. 1145). The custom here is
Greek; cf. Plutarch, Mor. 828 F„ [δανειστὴν] . . . κᾶν οἴκοι μένῃς, ἐπιστα-
θμεύοντα καὶ θυροκοποῦντα, etc. usque ad oet-lum: this ambulacrum,
as Simo describes it, admitted the sun up to the very door os the house.

769. nisi ei: nisi having in certain connections the force of ‘but,
except,' e.g. in 278 and 663, it was natural to reenforce it by a fresh si
(cf. ἓ 79. 1). in puteo: wells were proverbially dark 3 cf. Cas. 882,
sed tam tenebrae ibi erant quam in puteo.
