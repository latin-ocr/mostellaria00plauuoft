ACT ΙΙΙ. SCENE 1.—-VERSES 431-531.

(1) CHARACTERS. —In this scene Theopropides, who had been to
Egypt to improve his fortunes, is introduced, attended by two mute
porters. He is a typical father of Graeco-Roman comedy in being
stupid and having a moral code that asked economy of his son and
nothing more (cf. 1160 ᾗ). His most individual trait is his tiffldity,
resulting from his superstition (see notes on Personae).

(2) SYNOPSIS. —-'l‘his scene contains 'Tranio’s first triek. To keep
the old man from entering the house and catehing the revellers, he
invents a story that the house was accursed‚ haunted by a ghost.
Therefore, he said, it had been deserted by his young master. From
the ghost, as we have seen, the play took its name.

(3) Tun srAGE BosmEss presente difficulties which the directions in
the text have tried partially to account for. There is an interruption
from within the house, which Tranio cleverly puts upon the ghost.
Only the great terror and superstition of his old master allow him to
carry this off.

(4) Merum. —Dz'verbium, ξ 12; Iambic senarii, ἓξ 13-14.

432. quom : see note on 395 ; quom with this force is found ocea-
sionally in Cicero, med: on the form, see § 47.

433. pedem latum: we say rather a ‘hand's breadth' ; Plautus
also says finger's width, nail's breadth (Aul. 57) ; cf. also non pedem
discedere (Asin. 603). The idiom in pedem lacum is the ordinary
type represented by Juvenal, x. 292, pulchra gaudet Latona Dia-na,
‘ in Diana's beauty,' etc. ; cf. mortuos pater in 233.

434. inposisee: contracted from inposz’uisse (ξ 54, § 37. 2).
hau causant ε Ι raz'se πο objection.

435. nunc : Just now ,· note the combination with the perfect.

436. apage te: beyone; on (maye, see ξ 38. nunciam: from
now on, as we should perhaps render hic iam (107) by ‘from here on ’
(cf. also note on cum iam, 130).
