564] THE D1ALECT os PLAUTUs. xxxvii

(1066), cf. the construction of. mane (1089), which survived with later
poets and their prose imitators.

(3) 'rwo accusatives ε nil erit quod deorum ullum accusites (712),
⁴ you'll have naught to lay on any god ³3 hominem aedis posce (1091),
‘ demand the house of the fellow.’ In Plautus uolo also takes two
accusatives, e.g. Curculio, 343, quid eum uis 2³

(4) Accusative of exclamation: mulierem lepidam (206), eccum
Tranium (560) ; note the frequent combination of eccum, etc. (see ς
48.2), with nominatives: pater eccum aduenit (611, cf. 795) ; eon-
veniunt manuplares eccos (312).

(5) Α kindred idiom in ultro te (607), ‘ away with you.’

(6) The cognate accusative of the type neque quicquam suscenseo
(1163), ‘and I’m not a bit an'gry‚’ is common; cf. nullam rem sapis
(1094), ‘you haven’t a bit of sense.' Quod with verbs of sending
(747, 786) and going: scio quod properes (878), ⁶ I know what errand
(= why) you run,' is an idiom that we may derive from the cognate
accusative (but see note on 69) ε nisi quid mayis es occupatus (1008)
shows the cognate with a passive verb.

(7) Clam, ⁴ without the knowledge of,' takes the accusative (1054).

(8) The accusative (of the pronouns) is frequently omitted with
transitive verbs (59, 920-922).

64. The Ablative.—( 1) In temporal relations: note in uita:
per uitam (225); istac aetate, ‘ at your time oi life ’ (1148). As triennio
post :post triennium so the ablative adverbs postea, postilla, and the
like have the force of post eam (sc. tempestatem).

(2) Manner is expressed by curriculo (362), ‘in a trot' ; ioculo
(923), ‘in J'est'3 ordine (552), ‘in order’3 by phrases like miseris
modis (54) :misere ‚⁰ indiqnis modis(1033) :indique ‚· pessumis exemplis
(192) is a little more than pessume ‚· cf. 1040, quot. . . exemplis = quibus
modis, ut! In 658, minus bono cum iure means, in the predicate, about
the same thing as iniustius (adj)

(3) In the phrase faenore amentum datas (602), faenore is an
ablative of price, while in faenori arqentum sumpsisse (1140) the
same notion is expressed by the locative (= dative); nummo (115)
and nilo (200) express indefinite price.

(4) In Plautus comparison of equality, as well as of inequality, may
take the‘ ablative of comparisonst e.g. quo nemo adaeque.. .parcus
(30), ‘and no one was so frugal as he' (further examples in Lewis
and Short's lexicon s.vv, adaeque, aeque, 1. β). This usage shows
