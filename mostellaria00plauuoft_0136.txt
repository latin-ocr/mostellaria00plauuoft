84 NOTES. [Pron 8

(3) Tm: SrAeE—anmnss.—-Our scene begins with the, toilet of
Philematium, which, chiefly for reasons of theatrical exigency, is
represented as taking place before the house. However, in southern
countries‚ Mexico to the south of us, or Italy, a very fair amount
of the toilet of lower class women, at least the head-dressing, does
take place in the open. Compared with toilet soenes on the mod-
ern stage, in the opera of Fra Diavolo, for example, this toiIet is
modesty itself, so far as the language of the plays lets us infer. What
the stage-business might have made of it is matter for conjecture. A
modern actress, in a boudoir scene, would probably begin her dressing
not far from the bath-robe stage. In this ancient street scene the
‘ business‘ probably began with the final prinking before the mirror,
though, so far as the language goes, the outer frock (uestis) may
actually have been donned at 166.

(4) COMMENTS.—This scene, like the last, seems to us unduly
drawn out. Thus, verses 186-207, to take an example, are substan-
tially repeated in verses 208-223. A modern actor would doubtless
omit one passage or the other, and some ancient actor might perhaps
have written the one as a substitute for the other. On the other hand,
Scapha is tempting her mistress in these passages, and dramatic as
well as actual truth might suggest a repetition of this sort. With a
particularly grateful role like Philematium’s in hand, either poet or
actor might have wanted to dwell upon it.

(5) Tim Mamm is recitative (ἓ 15), divided between iambic Sep-
tenaria· (ἓ 16), verses 157-247, and trochaic septenarii (ἓ 18), verses
248-312.

159-160. The sentencia (ἓ 86) is: “All things have their end;
even as this year a great harvest has been reaped.'’ The harvest is the
harvest of death, the reaper, perhaps : cf. a poet, translating Euripides,
cited by Cicero, Tusc. Disp. iii. 59, uita omnibus metenda, ut sruyes,·
