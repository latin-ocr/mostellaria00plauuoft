37. fiducia: by pledyingy, at rislo os.

38. fu2·fohl This interjection was described by an ancient critic
as an inarticulate (illiteratus) sound; cf. Boswell's Johnson, anno
1764: “Generally when he had concluded a period . ’. . he used
to blow out his breath like a whale. This seemed in him to be a con-
temptuous mode of expression, as if he had made the arguments of
his opponent fiy like chaff before the wind.'’ Philosophical gibberish
so nauseated one of Lucian’s characters (Philop. 2) as to make him
cry, φῦ φῦ φῦ φῦ τῶν ὕθλων ἐκείνων, ‘fohl what stuff is this ι’ ·N0te
Congreve's Way of the World, IV. i.: “If you doubt him, you had
best take up with Sir Wilfull. . . . How can you name that super-
annuated lubber? Foh1'’ Also cf. Cas. 727, sy, sy, foetet tuos mihi
sermo, ⁴ soh, I’m sick of your talk.'

39. dique omnes perdant alii: for the phrase di . . . alii, cf. Persa,
755, dique alii omniS, also Poen. 460, (Venus et) dei deaeque ceteri ’,·
Trin, 944 3 Livy, 26, 8. 5 ; for the oath formula, see§ 90. oboluisti
alium: you have 9οε (ς 71. 3) a yar-lic smell; these words, though
coordinata excuse the previous imprecation‚ see ξ 74. 3; alium puns
on alii (§ 87): the quip in alium has a wide range in comedy, e.g.
in Midsummer Nz‘yht's Dream, IV, ii. end, “ And, most dear actors‚
eat no onions nor garlic‚ for we are to utter sweet breath.'’

40-41. Note the mass of epithets (ξ 88). · germana inluvies =
native filth, render by you filthy creature, and compare κονιορτός, ‘dust,'
but, as an epithet, ‘dirty fellow.’ In this epithet we may see a
pointed allusion to Grumio's name as explained in the note under
Personae. For the situation compare Congreve's Old Bachelor‚ IV. iv„
‘⁴ Oh, monstrous, filthy fellow . . . you stink of brandy and tobacco,'’
etc. rusticum herous (ἔρκος); the stable-yard of a farmhouse
was notoriously filthy (cf. Odyssey, 17. 297). hara sui: εἰς] sor
che piq (see 562. 3). caulae caprum: yoat-pen. These are items
111 the description of the stable-yard, being 111 a sort of partitive ap-
position with herous. With this string of farmyard epithets applied
to a farm-hand like Grumio, we may compare Shakespeare’s epithets
for a tailor in The Taminq osche SMew, IV. iii. 106 ff.

‘⁴ Ο monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread. thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quartem, hali-yard, quai-ter, nail l

Away, thou rag, thou quanflty, thou remnant !
