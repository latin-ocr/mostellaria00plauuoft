TITLE—PAGE.

(1) Mostellaria: an adJ‘ective derived from *mostellum‚ a diminu-
tive to monstrum, ‘ prodigy’; sc. fabula‚· render by the play of the
little yhost. The title of another of Plautus's comedies is Cistellaria,
‘the play of the little chest.’ The Greek original of our play was
called Phasma, ‘Ghost.' This original is attributed to Philemon,
partly because of the ‘ gag' in 1149 (see note), and partly because of
the not inconsiderable stylistic likeness between the Mostellaria and
the Trinummus, which is a certain adaptation from Philemon.

(2) There are several imitations or adaptations of the Mostellaria
in English. In Ben Jonson’s Alche‘mist we have a plot turning on

(see note on 544); while Thomas Heywood’s The Enylz‘sh Traveller
translates a good portion of the Mostellaria, interweaving this mate·
rial with a very different plot. This play would make a good subject
for the study of contaminati0n‚ —a process by which Terence, and
Plautus, t00‚ if we may believe Terence (cf. Andria, Prologue 18),
built up a single Latin play from parts of two Greek plays. Another
rather close adaptation of the Mostellaria is the novelist Fielding’s
comedy of The Intriyuinq Chambermaz'd.

(3) The relation between Shakespeare's Taming] os the Sltrew and
the Mostellaria is also interesting. This relation lias been declared to
consist of nothing save the taking over of the names Tranio and
Grumi0‚· but in both plays Tranio is the temptet· and seducer of an
exceeding well brought up young master (cf. wareto, I. i.‚ with the
