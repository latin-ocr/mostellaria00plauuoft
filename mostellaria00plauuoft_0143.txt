23¹7. For the caesura in this verse, see §17‚ end. in te . . .
parcus: cf. in aliquo . . . restrictus (see Lewis and Short, Lat. Dice.
s.v. restrinqo, ΙΙ. Β). principium . . . experiri = initium experi-
undi facere, principium being a cognate accusative. ut: here
experiri has the construction of nituntur in 128.

239. si uoles: is you will please to ; future to sis (see note on 1).
For their difference, see note on si uiuam, 4.

240. nec recte . . . dixeris = male d.; cf. Bacch. 118-119‚ mali
sunt homines qui bom‘s dicunt male. Ι tu dis nec recte dicis. There are
some half a- dozen instances [Asin. 155, 471 ; Poen. 516 ; Pseud. 1085 ;
cf. Bacch.. 735 (loqui)] of this locution in which nec recte seems to be
a fixed formula, cf. necopinans, and neq· (for nec ?) in neyleqo, neqo-
tium .· this ne-c: may have in c the same formative clement as the -κ of
Greek οὐ-κ, and not be the shortened form of neque. uapulabis:
active form, but passive meaning ; from the time of Thersites down to
the ring-master, whip, and clown of the contemporary circus, beating
and talk about beating has been a stock comio motis.

241—242. Ioui inuido: inuidus occurs but twice elsewhere in
Plautus, and clearly means yreecly .· Persa, 409, pecunias (gen.) accipi-
ter auide atque inuide, Ι procax, rapax, trahax,· and Trin. 285, rapax,
auarus, inuidus. In Poen. 457 and 461, Venus is called auara, and
the other gods and goddesses auidi. Unwilling offerers of giss-,s and
sacrifice would have found it easy to call a god inuidus. There is
some, but not certain, inscriptional evidence for the di inuidi (see
Forcellini-de Vit, Lex. s.v. inuidus), and the Greeks openly taxed the
gods with envy of the fortunate (see Liddell and Scott, Greek Lexicon,
ΒΝ. φθονερός, 2) ; cf. also Livy, v. 21, 15. But here perhaps inuidus is
an epitheton ornans, and the jealousy of the gods is referred to ; cf.
Odyssey v. 118, θεοὶ ζηλήμονεςς Nonnus, D. 27, 97 is cited expressly for
ζηλήμων Κρονίδης (Ζεύς). argento sacuficaesem . . . quod dedi:
had sacrificed in silver (ablative of means) che sum chat I yave. For
arqento, see note on aleato, 48.

243. ut uideas: take notice ,· uideas is the ideal 2d person (see
ς 67. 2). Here ut is used with a subjunctive of command, rather than
wish ; cf. Persa, 36, ut mihi cles nummos sescentos . . . aqefi beniynus .·
subueni‚· Stich. 106, sed ucraque ut (licat mihi, ‘but tell me one at a
time’ ; Trin. 347, bene si amico seceris, ne pz'yeac secisse: ἰιι potius
pudeat, si non seceris, ‘if you've helped a friend, don't regret it;
rather be ashamed if you haven't.' But uc uideas has been corrected
