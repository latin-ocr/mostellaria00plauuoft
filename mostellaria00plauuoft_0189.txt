in smoke,’ whence ‘demented.' For the idea we may compare Deu-
teronomy, xxxii. 15, ‘ But J eshurun waxed fat and kicked ' (also Aris-
tophanes, Plut. 521 ff.) 3 perhaps in Cicero, Sest. 24, ita domus ipsa
fumabat means ‘and the very house(hold) poured out such vapor-
ings.' This metaphor, particularly characteristic for a volcanic coun-
try like Italy, manifests itself more explicitly in eructare ‘ to beleb, to
fume.'

891. oculi dolent: my eyes smart, punning with the rendering of
ferocem sacis. fumus: obviously prepared for by sumam we can
nearly render the equivoque by an, vaporinys. There is a curious
resemblance to this use of fumus in Kiny John, ΙΙ. i. 227, “And now,
instead of bullets wrapped in fire, Ι To make a shaking fever in your
walls, Ι They shout but calm words, folded up in smoke, Ι To make*
a faithless error in your ears.'’ Greek καπνός and τῦφος have the
same metaphorica] use as sumus. In Asin. 619, we have another
quip on sumus .· sed num sumus esi haee mulier quam amplexare 5⁴ ε z
quidum βε : quia oculi sunt cibi lacrumanti33 cf. also Aristophanes,
Plut. 821.

892. faber: with the bad sense, still alive in English ‘fabricate’
qui . . . nummos: Casaubon (cited by Lorenz) interpreted by: qui
simulatis officiis et speciosis dictis ac fizciis ero persuasisti te esse
sruyi seruom, cum nequam sis. cudere plumbeos nummos: to
counterfeit small-chan9e‚· ‘small-change' is equivocal for ⁶ small-
talk.' The locution was Greek ; cf. Cratinus, 226, ἁργυροκοπιστῆρας
λόγων, which Hesychius defines as ‘changers of words' (cf. ‘swap-
ping J’okes'). Leaden coins of Greece and Rome, obviously counter-
feit‚ are still extant3 cf. Cas. 258, quoi homini hodie peculi nummus
non est plumbeus.

894. A similar insinuation made in Persa, 192, provokes the reply
that though such insinuations are made, the slanderer won't risk a
trial of the charges, This shows how largely conventional such
taunts are. We find a parallel to this passage in Persa, 284.

895. sis . . . dicas: implying unreality (see ᾗ 69. 3).

896. quom . . . nequeas ι the subjunctive is due to attraction (cf.
ς 66. 4) from optemperem ‚· in sense nequeas approximates nolis, by a
very evident psychology ε when our friends say ‘ we can't,' our retort
is ‘ you won't.'

897-898. abstine . . . sermonem: see (2) at the head of this
scene.
