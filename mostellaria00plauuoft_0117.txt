, Scapha: the rendering Vane is suggested by the use—not known
to be ancient—of a boat for a weathercock. A parasite and flatterer
was called a boat (λέμβος) by Anaxandrides, odyss. 2. 7, ὄπισθεν ἀκολου-
θεῖ κόλαξ τῳς λέμβος ἐπικέκληται, ‘should a flatterer tag after us, we
dub him trailer'; cf. the definition in Nonius (535): scaphae sunt
nauiculae quae maiores naues consecuntur. Abbreviated Sc.

Callidamates: (Beauty-tamer P) Lady-killer. Abbreviated Cd.

Delphium: abbreviated De.

Sphaerio: abbreviated Sp.

Theopropides: Prophetson. This name is doubly applicable to
the old gentleman, first, because of his superstition, and secondly, be-
cause he is as wax in the hands of the slave Tranio, himself a revealer
of no mean parts. There is a note of irony, too, sor Theopropides is a
very stupid foil to his clever slave contratype. Abbreviated Th.

Misargyrides, danista: Hace-silver—son, money-lenden The name
is obviously ironical. Abbreviated Da.

Simo: abbreviated Si.

Phaniscus: Lictle Revealer. Cf. Φᾶνός, the name of a sycophant
in Aristophanes, Eq. 1256. Abbreviated Ph.

PInacium: Greek πινάκιον, ‘tablet.' A spiteful messenger in the
Stichus also has this name. The πινάκιον was a voting tablet or con-
tained information in a case of εἰσαγγελία. Abbreviated Pi.

Lorarii: Fcoqyers. These are mute characters. Other mute per-
sonae, addressed by the leading characters, but not indicated in scene
headings, are employed in the play.
