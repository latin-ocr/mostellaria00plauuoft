Pion 24] Ac'r 111. SCENE 1. 109

sity as the passive, mihi credendum suit, would do ; see also note on
debebas, 321. ”

Epid. 484, stulte datum Ι reor, peccatum larqiter.

names; see ξ 65. 2 and the note on 66, comparing Dolabella in Cicero,

443. qui nuntiaret: a sort of shorthand for qui (= siquis, see

444. interdius: in broad dayliqht‚· if -dius is not an accusative
plural of the same ‘dec'lension' as diu, ‘by day‚' Plautus probably
thought so; cf. Aul. 72, peruiyilat noctes totas, tum autem interdius
quasi claudus sutor domi sedet totos dies. A similar formation is
incernias, ‘along the ways ' (Aul. 379). If this is correct, the form
interdiu has been assimilated to diu ‚· conversely we find dius (Mero.
862) assimilated to interdius.

composition with re-‚ the converse meaning. respondeat: see

ω cur non tanqam (see ξ 66. 3), ⁶ why am I not to touch ‘2 ’
