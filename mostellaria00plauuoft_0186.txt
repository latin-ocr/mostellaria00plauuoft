858. quom: for its mood construction, see §66. 4.

860. nam: while ,· mildly adversative3 cf. Lewis and Short‚ Lat.
Dice. s.v. Ι. Β., 4.

862. exercent . . . cursuram: fugiunt: they train for munina,
(and) off they 90. The language is technica13 cf. Trin. 1016, yuryuliost
exercitor, is hunc hominem cursuram docet; Stich. 306, simulque ad
cursuram meditabor ad ludos Olympios, where ‘meditabor differs but
little from exercebo; cf. Pliny, Ν.Η. 8, §113, cerui editos partu-⁹
(their young) exercent cursu, et fuyam meditari docent‚· it is clear
from Bacch, 67, ubi pro disco damnum capiam, pro cursura dedecus,
that cursura was a part of gymnastic training3 cf. cursu, 153 above.
reprehensi = classical comprehensi, ‘ caught, arrested‚' with the added
force perhaps of ‘ brought back.'

869. ut notem: depends on the verb of effecting, textum habebo
(‘ shall have contrived ’), in the next verse; on the spelling of uocem,
see §36. 2. uerberare: sc. lorarios (ᾗ 72. 1).

870. huic: 1.8. laeuae manu ,· cf. Epid. 10, corpulentior uidere
acque habitior 2: huic qratia, ‘thanks to this left’ (showing his left
hand) ; cf. Catullus, 12, manu sinistra non belle uteris (addressed to
the napkin pilferer) ; an allusion to thieving here is compatible with
what is left of 863. textum habebo: analytical future perfect
for texero.

871. 118 inpluat: repeats the sense of ut uocem uerberare; we
also speak of 8 ‘rain of blows.'

872. nam . . . solet: here we have either a comical inversion of
the proverb, “like master, like man '⁹ (cf. Petronius, 58, plane qualis
dominus talis esc seruos), or 8 general truism, “a thing is what you
make of it,'' specifically pointed.

8¹74. nam: why‚· cf. 394.

875. plagigeruli: cf. playipatidae, 356.
