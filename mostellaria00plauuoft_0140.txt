88 NOTES. [Plan 10

sim: quae is probably interrogative (ξ 49. 1); the second quae is ex-
clamatory(what 1) ; uides quae fuerim, ⁴ you see what Ι was‚’ would
make nonsense‚ unless we assumed a zeugma whereby uides would
imply ‘ you know.’

200. nilo: like nummo (115, 333 note), 13 311 ablative of price3
further cf. Naevius, 105 (Ribbeck,2 vol. ii), eius noctem nauco ducere.
quam: the correlative tam is omitted, as in Rud. 943, non edepol
piscis (sc. tam) expeto Ι quam tui sermonis sum indiyens. Render
nilo . . . amata sum by I sold my favor-5 (as) gyratis (cheap, low) as
you do now. gessi morem : 333 note on 189.

201-202. me. . . me: the second me is pleonastic (ξ 79. 2), but
the pleonasm is relieved by the two verbs: similar pleonasms in
Amph. 534 (tibi), Aul. 551 (mihi), Cure. 577 (me); also see note
011 164. tibi: see ξ 62. 2.

203. uix comprimor: I can hardly keep 'mysels in check; not-e
the potential (ξ 66. 3) and reflexive (ξ 52) rendering of comprimor.

is osten well suited to the indicative.' illi stimulatrici: render
according to §6:2. 4.

placet ille meus smmi mendicus, ‘that beggar (-husband) of mine
suits 1ne,' and of Terence's Phorm. 587, nam eqo meorum solus sum
meus, ‘ for of my belongings I am my only own.' Solam agrees with
the subject of oportere ,· sc. me (ξ 72. 1), 33 111 1148 ; cf. Aul. 757, sed
meam esse (sc. illam) oportere arbim-0⁷3· render solam in both cases
by ‘above all others‚' or ‘nobody but me.’

205. This verse stands in causal coordination (333 § 74. 3) with 204.
ille: the name had been mentioned twice before (167, 182), but per·
haps ‘ille is honorific (ξ 48. 1); cf. also Stich„ cited in last note.
