110 NOTES. [mon 24

457. uah z see note on 256. quid est ε see note on 364.
458. male . . . iactum: you've played the mischies; cf. sactum

optume, 449.

459. facinus iecisti: note the repetition (ξ 79. 3). ,

460. quid iam: the third member of the climax quid est, . . .
quid est neyoti. Tranio, by retarding its development, is giving point
to his ghost story.

462. non tangerem: a repetition, in dependence upon si, from
455.

463. occidisti . . . mortalem: mortalis is used for homo in
suitable connectione 3 e.g. Livy, v. 16. 6, multos ‘mortalis obtruncant.

465. The imprecation is here interrupted by the impatience of
Tranio. ut possies : the catch as to the force of ut with a verb of
fearing may be illustrated by comparing the following English sen-
tence: “Where a million people live, I have no sear of getting a
share '' (W. T. Sherman, cited in the N. Y. Semiweekly Eveninq Post,
Feb. 15, 1900). Similarly, if we render ut possies by ‘your ability
to,' the (English) need of the negative disappears.

466. quam . . . rem . . . nouam :quid noui (cf. ἓ 80).

46¹7. The suture of 467 with 465 is close enough psychologicallyz
“I'm feariul about your ability to reconcile with the gods yourself
and family —: : . . . : :- and do get those other fellows [the porters, -
see introduction to the scene] off, don't implicate them.” ’

468. attigatis: on the form, see §51, and on the construction,
ἓ 67. 1. tangite . . . terram : in the practice of witchcraft it was

 

a preventive and remedy against illness or other evil to touch the ·

earth. Varro, RB. i. 2, 27, after a formula appropriate to driving off
the gout, adds, hoc ter noviens cantare iubet, terram tanyere, etc.;
cf. also Marcellus Empiricus, 28. 74 and 25. 13. The Greek custom of
reverencing the earth belongs to a somewhat higher religious sphera
(cf. AristophaneS, Eq. 155, ἄγε δὴ σύ, κατάθου πρῶτα τὰ σκεύη χαμαί·
ἔπειτα τὴν ’γὴν πρόσκυσον καὶ τοὺς θεούς). The Romans had, however, a
hymn to dea sancta Tellus (Buecheler and Riese's Anthol. Lat. Ι.
p. 26). The positive command, tanyite . . . quoque, following the
negative command, ne . . . atciyatis, is in our idiom adversative,
whence quoqu-e, ‘also,' = ‘but rather'; similar is et in an instance
like nec miror et ‚caudeo (Cicero, ad Fam. X. 1.·4).

469. rem: the point, the matter,· cf. rem in 199 3 and Cicero, de
Div. i. 54, detulit rem, ‘he told the dream (occurrence).'
