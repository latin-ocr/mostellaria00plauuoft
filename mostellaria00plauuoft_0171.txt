⁴ wicked' ?) [Men. 8533 cf. Terence, Adelph. 183, 360] 3 (4) Bacch. 12
is too fragmentary for interpretation3 haud impurus seems to mean
‘genereus ' in Terence, Eun. 2353 and ‘ fair-dealing’ in Heaut. 629.

621. perfacile . . . perpetior: see note on 203.

622. uidetur ι for the type of question, see ς 73. 1. 6.

623. qui = quis ,· see note on quae, 199.

627. quantillum ε cf. tantillo, 394. quasi : (somethiny) like.
quadraginta minas: inconsistent with 300, but reveals the usual
attempt of a swindlin’g slave to square up and have a private balance left.

628. ne . . . censeas ε a convenient rendering is, surely you can't
think, but the subjunctive (see §67. 1) is not potentia13 cf. ut uideaS,
243.

629. adeo etiam: the pleonasm is relieved somewhat by taking
etiam with creditum, and adeo with audio — a construction to which
their assonance and metrical polarity lends probability.

630. quattuor: for the synizesis, see ς 7. 1.

631. · nilo plus: to demand more than was due invalidated a claim
for debt at Rome. It was by appealing to a provision derived from

πατρῴζω. homo: little more than is (ille) ,· see Krebs, Antibar-
barus‚ επ. homo, and the note on 704. uertitur : in classical Latin
we should expect uersatur for ‘ engages in business.'

640. nam: resuming, well (see note on 5).

641. alias: cf. alteras in 270.

642. quoiusmodi: for the synizesis‚ see ξ 7. 2.

643. uah: a ‘ whew ! ' of admiration ; cf. 256, and Cure. 449,
nah Ι : : quid mirare ἲ

645. speculo claras: briyht to a mirror, i.e. even a mirror would
call the house splendid ‚· speculo is dativus iudicanti& as in 251, though
perhaps we may regard the dative here as a variation for ad, ⁶ in com-
parison witli'3 cf. Capt. 275, ad sapientiam huius nimius nuyator
suit. claras, candorem: see ς 63. 4.
