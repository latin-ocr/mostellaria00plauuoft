5'50] THE DIALECT or PLAUTUS. xxxiii

48. Demonstratives (Determinatives, eta). — (1) Significa-
tion: Hic, ‘ this (here) ' (including for hic, as well as the other de-
monstratives, their adverbial forms), contrasted with ille, ‘ yonder,' is
used of what is locally close or temporally near by, ille being used of
the remote3 contrasted with iste, hic relates to the first person, while
iste is employed of the second. In this usage, as the speaker changes,
hic becomes iste, or vice versa, e.g. hosce (822) becomes istis (823),
and hasce becomes istas (988) ; cf. 918-919, where isti is echoed by
huic, and in 964-965, istic by hic. But iste may be used to make an
abusive or deprecatory reference to a third person or class of persons
(274, 480, 655, 668, 798 [3], 843, 854, 918), even persons in the audi-
ence (356). Further, the distinction between these pronouns seems
now and then to break down, e.g. huc (835) is echoed by illic (836).
See also notes 011 913, 919, and 921. If iste is contemptuous, ille is
sometimes honorific (398), and sometimes connotes -‘ the proverbial‚’
‘ the typical ’ (see note on 362).

(2) Porms: Illisce, hisce (nom. plur.) are consonant-declension
(= i-stem) forms.

The enclitic particle -ce (-c) has a much wider range than it
enioys in the classical period, e.g. nom. plur. masc. hisce, fem. haec,·
gen. plur. harunc; acc. hosce, hasce ‚· abl. hisce; interrogative forms
of hic with -ne are hicine, hicin, haecine, hocine: istic (= iste) and
illic (= ille) show similar forms, e.g. dat. sing. istic (983), acc. istanc,
neut. plur. and fem. sing. istaec; is has dat. sing. ἑι· (947) and nom.
plur. ,ῖ (spelled εἰ, 121) ; ipsus stands beside ipse, eumpse beside ipsum ,·
the interJection ecce, ‘yonder‚’ is a quasi-demonstrative, with the case
forms eccum, eccam, eccos), eccas, which often appear to be in apposi-
tion with the subject of a sentence (§ 63. 4).

49. Interrogative, Relative, Indefinite: (1) quis and qui are
not thoroughly differentiated in Plautus (e.g. quae = quis 5³ 199).

(2) Two sets of forms, which may be conveniently regarded as:
1) consonant-declension (= i-stem) forms (dat. sing. aliqui [?], 358),
abl. sing. (all genders and both numbers) qui‚· dat.-ab1. plur. quibus,-
2) vowel-declension (o-stem) forms, abl. sing. quo, abl. plur. quis [P] ;
3) add the archaic forms, quoius (quoiius) and quoi = cuius, eui.

50. Pronominal Adverbs. —1) Usage ε they often stand for
case forms of the pronouns, eg. inde = ab (ex) eo (103); usquam =
alicunde=ab altero (269); nusquamznemz’m‘ (303), etc. 2) Porms:
hoc, ‘hither, this way,' isco(c)‚ ‘thither‚' illo(c), ‘yonder,' alio, ‘else-
