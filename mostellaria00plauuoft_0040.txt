cf. 27, bom· est officium serui, ‘’tis a good slave's part.' Examplee
like magni sunt oneris (782), ‘ they are very strong‚' are genitives of
quality in the predicate. Akin to the officium example is viri doetist

opus (412), ‘ 'tis the task of a clever man,' in which we have, perhaps,

the original construction of opus est.

the predicate, ranging between quid esc neqoti, ‘what's the matter,’

quently stand for their own genitives, e.g. id exemplum (90)= eius
rei exemplum (P).

(3) Adnominal dative: hara sui (40), ‘Sty for the pig’3 oi rei

aryumenta (92), ‘proofs for this point' 3 arymnenca aedificiis (118), ,

the following, of a ship personified, nostrae naui quae sranqat ratem
(740), ⁴ to break our boat's timbers for it.’
