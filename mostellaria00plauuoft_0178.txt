tragedy as a circumlocution for ναῦς, though σκάφος alone often =
ναῦς. In the passage before us there is perhaps a parody os the tragic
style.

742. uelim ut tu uelle: I'd like to wish as you (wish, sc. uis);
interpret by Amph. 39, debitis uelle quae uelimus, and the formula—
common and of many sub-varieties-—omnia quae tu uis cupio (Persa,
766); a closer parallel is ovid, Amor. iii. 11, 49, tu seliqe (‘choose ')
tantum Ι (sc. utrum) me quoque. velle uelis, anne coactus amem. For
the repetition, see ξ 79. 6, and cf. Oapt. 248, te oro . . . qui nunc sis
meminisse ut memineris

744. ferriterium: a momentaneous compound of serrum and a
derivative of terit, ‘wears' (cf. ferritribaces in 356), designating the
place where the qenus ferratile (19) was confined.

746. m'l moror: I don't (want to) keep (see note on 794).

747. quod: perhaps = qua causa (see note on 69, but cf. note on
786). The abrupt change from canticum to diverbium in this verse
may be compared with the change in 409. It is a curicus, and perhaps
not accidental, correspondence that at the first of these abrupt changes
Tranio has just been constituted a patronus to his young master, and
at the second Tra-nio constitutes Simo his patronus. Such inversions
have an indisputable comic effect, and seem characteristic of this
play ; Tranio is a sort of inversion of Theopropides (see note on Per·
sonae); for other cases of inversion, see notes on 365 and 512.

749. iam . . . quid sensit: has he yot any inkliny yet 5·

750. nil quicquam: for similar pleonasms, see ς 79. 2. num-
quid: a ize-question (see ξ 73. 3).

751. tam liquidus quam liquida : a pleonastic type of compari-
son 3 cf. Mile-5, 664, leniorem dices quam mutumst mare ‚· similar, but
less pleonastic, is Coleridge's famous line, ‘⁴ As idle as a painted ship
upon a painted ocean.’'

752. opere maxumo : see note on 421.

755. gynaeceum: as compared with γυναικεῖον, note the adoption
(certainly in 7 59, and probably here) of the Latin shortening of vowel
before vowel ; to the Roman audience the word ,wnaeceum would
sound as foreign as harem to us, separate women's apartments not
being in the Roman order of things,

756. balineae, etc. ε bath-room's‚ a promenade‚ and vetanda were
doubtless rare in Roman private houses in the time of Plautus, but
were well suited to Tranio's Greekish castle-in-the-air. ambu-
