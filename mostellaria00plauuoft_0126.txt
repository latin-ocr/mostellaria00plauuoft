74 NOTES. [Pion ε»

67. in uesperum ε· for the eveuiny meai. parare: to proeure‚·
for construction, see ξ 72. 3. piscatum: note the formation in
-atus, and see note on aleaio, 48. With parare piscatum, compare
obsonate in 24.

68. faxo : for the form, see § 54. adferat: for the construction,
see ξ 68.

69. quid esi: quod: whai's the reason that 13⁹ why 9 In this formula,
quod may have causal force; cf. Aul. 435, quid est qua prohibes
nunc qratia *nos coquere hic, where qua qratia seems to show the
Roman feeling for quod. We may grant that all pronominal ablatives
in -d (see Lindsay's Latin Inscripiions, p. 13, ἓ 10), save med andied
(ξ 47), had perished before Plautus's time, and still believe that the
neuter accusative quod· was residuary legatee of functione of the
ablative *quc->ci It seems possible, however, that quod, ‘why,’ with
verbs of motion, had its origin as a cognate accusative (see ξ 63. 6) ;
though an example like the following, Bacch. 249, quid hoc qua causa
eum hinc in Ephesum miseram, where quod might be substituted for
qua causa, suggests that here also quod was causa13 cf. note on 691.
optuere: scowl ai. furcifer: literally cross-bearer, alludes to the
punishment more fully described in the note on 55. As usual, the
epithet is desiderative 3 compare the paraphrase iu Uist. 248, diqnu's
. . . qui furcam serus.

70. tibi: for the construction see §62 2. istuc nomen: the
title you bestow, see ἓ 48. 1.

71. istuc ‘actutum' sino : I ’ll noi mind your ‘by and by)

72. ita est; sed, etc.: never mind or very well‚· cf. Poen. 237,
itast, uerum hoc unum iumen coqueio, etc„ and Turpilius, 9, iia est:
uerum haud facilest uenire illi ubi sua esi sapiencia. In all these
cases iia esi ironically admits a statement, preparatory to citing a
proverb in refutation. nimio ε an exaggeration for multo (see ξ 4).

73. For the general phraseology of this proverb (ἓ 86), cf. Pseud.
281, nimio id quod pudet facilius fertur quam illud quod piyei.
uenire . . . moleste: for the shortening of words become dissyl-
labic by elision‚ see §6. 1. moleste est: sc. tibi, and cf. tibi
nialesi, 52. cupide petas: for the phraseology, cf. Cas. 267,
cupide cupis, and see ἓ 79. 4 ; for the mood of petas, see §67. 2. Note
the inconcinnity of uenire . . . petas, and see ξ 76.

74. nunciam: here and throughout Plautus a trisyllable (see
§35).
