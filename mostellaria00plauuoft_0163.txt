Pion 25] Ao'r 111. SCENE 1. 111

47].. tetulit: 011 the form, see ς 54. semel ut ε when once ,· in
our idiom, ever since. ’

473. aucupet: eavesdrop‚· the bird-catcher [au(i)-ceps] had
stealthy habits, whence the extension of meaning. tutum probent:
ic's pretty sase.

474. etiam: cf. 377 and 423.

4¹76. antiquom et uetus: a common pleonasm in Plautus3 cf.
Pliny, Epist. iii. 6. 3, aes (⁶ the bronze ⁹) ipsum uetus et anticum ‚⁰ and
cf. mirum auc nouom (345).

477. adeo: adeo after pronouns has much the same emphasizing
and slightly adversative force as quidem. nunc : Just now ‚· with a
perfect as in 435.

478. sceleste: an equivoque‚ perhaps; not only is sceleste a not
unusual form of address to such as Tranio, but sceleste, ‘ full of scelus‚’
is perhaps an impatient momentaneous designation for one that keeps
saying scelus. cedo ι here and in 572 = tell (cf. ξ 43).

479. hospes . . . hospitem: in the Greek and Roman relation
of guest-and-host (ξενία, hospicium) each party to the compact enjoyed
the title, ξένος, hospes. The relation was of great religious sanctity;
observe how Tranio rings the changes on this awe-inspiring word in
481-482.

480. iste: here contemptuous (see note on 274) ; Tranio, as the
sequel shows, was rash in dating his ghost so recently.

481. ei ε dative of the loser (see note on 235).

484. Note the superfluous details Tranio introduces to give his
story the air of circumstantial veracity.

486. abimus: for the form, see ς 37. 2.

487. oblitus fueram: on the form, see ς 71. 7. The ghost is made
to walk by candle—light as a way of giving evidential value to the
story. In the Athenian ghost-story told by Pliny (Epist. vii. 27) the
watcher for the ghost likewise provides himself with a light (and a
notebook Γ), so as to record his actual observations.

488. atque: and then (= when) ; cf. Oapt. 479, ‘quo imus’
inquam ‘arl prandium ⁹? acque (⁶ but then') illc· tace-nm Juvenal iii.
215, ardet adhuc et (‘and then') iam accurrit, etc. Familiar in
Virgil is vix followed by a ‘temporal' et or -que (eg. Aen. ii. 692,
v. 858). ille: Philolaches, though his father is not quite sure.
exclamat . . . maxumum: yives a lond cry. derepente: cf.
de subito, 411.
