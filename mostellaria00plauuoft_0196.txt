996. ita: see note on 56.

997. scibo: for the form, see §54. unde: see note on inde,
103 ; eccum furnishes the antecedent.

998. a foro . . . domum: the same sort of answer as accubas in
368.

999. processit: rare in the sense of euenit ‚· obviously used to
prepare for efferri mortuom in the next verse, which plays on a technical
sense of procedit exhibited in Terence’s Andr. 127, sunus . . . procedit.

1000. etiam: yes (ξ 91).

1001. nouom: cf. rem . . . nouam, 466. unum: α, cf. 691,
and Lewis and Short, Lat. Dico. s.V. unus, II. A. 1 3 in English, ‘a’ is
a by-form of ⁴ one‚' cf. German εἰη and e i n.

1002. uixisse = e uita excessisse (z juisse, ἓ 71. 2; see note on
fuerant, 821) ; cf. Bacch. 151, uixisse nimio satiust iam quam
uiuere.

1003. res nouas = noua (ξ 80), cf. numquid . . . noui, 999.

1004-1005. promisi foras: I have an enyayemenc out, α previous
enyayement. A dinner was a proper courtesy to extend to a returned
traveller; here Simo excuses himself from making the invitation.

- Similar quips on this custom are very common, e.g. Cure. 561-562,

Epid. 6-7, Stich. 471, Trin. 991-992. uocare: for the tense, see
72. 2.
ἓ 1006. haud postulo: postulo in Plautus is often but a strong
verb of wishing ; see note on 613.
1007. me, uel apud te cenauero : suddenly substituted (ς 87. 2)

for te, uel apud me uocauero.

1008. quid: a cognate accusative with a passive is rare in Latin ;
examples with the active in 539, 613.

1009. maxume : with all my heare (ξ 91).

1010-1011. quod sciam : co the best of my knowledye and belies;

that characterized the knowledge at second-hand of Theopropides, and
Simo's first-hand knowledge.

1015. potesse = pote (see note on 256) 4- esse. iniectum

reddere: to (sec undone ‚· cf. insecta facio, 184; such periphrastic
turns with reddere and facere emphasize completion, much as the use

of perfect for present tenses (ᾗ 71. 4, 6) does.
1017. gesserit: a subjunctive of echo (§ 67. 3).
