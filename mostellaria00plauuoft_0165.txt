burial to be put under the ground, but a burial must be ritually cor-
rect, with “priest and book '‚' (cf. Horace, odes, i. 28. 21 ff).

503. scelestus: see note on sceleste, 487; but the sense of seele-
racus‚ ‘ accurst,' lies near.

504. scelestae: for the quantity, see ς 6. 1.

505. This verse gives the play its title (see notes on title-page).

506-508 st st z the curious insiderS, we may suppose, have gath-
ered behind the door to listen, and with this interjection one of them
cautious the rest to silence. Th‘e old gentleman hears the whisper,
and cries out in alarm. Or perhaps st sc was a cautious attempt to
signal from the inside to Tranio. In either ease, Tranio turns the in-
cident to good account by asking (508), hicine percussit, the qhosc
didn'c ΙσηοοΙσ, did he ἵ) (cf. ξ 73. 1).

507. ioris: for the number, see ς 59.

509. accersunt Acheruntem: Plautus prefers accerso or arcesso
as alliteration suggests ; but cf. 1044 and 1093.

510. illisce: for the form, see ᾗ 48. 2. hanc . . . fabulam:
i.e. ⁶ my coup cle ιὴὲᾶινε ’ (see note on 937).

511. nimis quam 'formidoz a blend of nimis (cf. 176) formido
and quam formido (cf. 543); the combination nimis quam occurs
also in Gapt. 102 and True. 468.

512. quid tute tecum loquere : note how the conventional aside
oi the drama is overheard but not understood, and cf. Cymbeline, 11. i.
27 ff. abscede ab ianua: away from the door! a comical inver-
sion (see notes on 365, 7 47) in the master's mouth of the slave's former
words (460 ft). Tranio is clearly trying to get into unobserved com-
munication with the insiders, while his master fears he is talking to
the ghost.

513. quo fugiam ‘? Etiam tu iugis: where shall Ι run ιο 5³ Will
you run coo 2³

514. pax . . . mortuis: a probable allusion to Tranio's character
(see note on Personae) as a sort of Hermes διάκτορος or ψυχοπομπός.

515. heus Tranio: this remark from the inside must have been
inaudible to Theopropides. non . . . appellabis: having got
near the door, Tranio addresses his first direct eonununication to the
insiders. '

516. nil ego commerui : here only does Plautus use commereo(r)
without noxia, culpa, or malum as an object, and as the glosses also

render commerui by male merui, male eyi, offendi wc may render by
