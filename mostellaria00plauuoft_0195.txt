was connected with the horn of plenty (Antiphanes, in Kock, ii. 54).
There is probably allusion here also to Tranio-Picus3 cf. Aul. 701, picis
diuitiis qui aureos montis colunt Ι eqo solus supero, where mention
is made of the fabulous measure-pices. For the sense ‘hoard,' cf.
Horace, Sat. Ι. 1. 37, mayni formica laboris Ι . . . illis utitur ante 1
quaesitis sapiens ‚· ibid. ii. 6. 82, asper et attentus quaesitis is said of
the frugal country mouse; cf. also the synonymous compositis, ibid.
ii. 3. 109, nescius uti Ι compositis. If quaesitum is a participle, the
variation in number (see note on uerum, ‘truth,’ 181) between the
two authors is to be noted 3 but quaesitum (both here and in 1107) may
belong to quaesitus, a by-form of quaestus ‚· cf. the phrase in quaes-
tione esse (Oapt. 2533 Oist. 5933 Persa, 51 ; Pseud. 663) but once, in
quaesitione esse (Oas. 530). So we may put beside attentus quaesitis
(Horace, l.c.) Cicero’s quaesticulis attentior (ad. Fam. ix. 16. 7).

985. ne : see note on 75 ; here ne belongs with me rather than eiu-3.
misere miseret: pleonastic (5 79. 4). istaec : for the form, see
5 48. 2.

986. ei: sor the force of the case, see 5 62. 4. corculum car-
bunculus .· a pair of diminutives (5 40) together ; the figure of heart-
burnings is well known.

987. quid merear.. . mentiar· a variety of the formula found
in 370. quam. here perhaps a purpose relative.

989. alio: elsewhitlzer (5 50. 2). comisatum: cf. 317 and 335.

abiisse: sc. eos (ξ 72. 1).
992. nisi ut : does not lend itself here to the explanation advanced

at 663 : the ut-clause concedes, — ⁴ granting that,' —or depends on a
general notion likeea ῑ898, ‘on condition that’ (cf. 360): cf. Pliny,
Epist. III. 12. 4, quos uituperare ne inimici quidem possint nisi ut
simul laudent (‘without . . . praising’) ; in Uist. 41, and Stich. 269,
we have purpose ut-clauses after nisi. qui ε as in 258.
