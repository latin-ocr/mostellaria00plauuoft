spective of metrical position, to the word accent on the penult. Thus,
though the adverbial endings of second-declension adJ'ectives are -ἑ and
-ὂ, ὂέηέ and οἶιό became pyrrhics, while ρῡνὲ and optume retained their
legitimate early quantities. Similarly in verb infiexion we have ᾶπιό,
but moueb, ploro. If we find amo, it is due either to the speech of
individuals of slow utterance, or to a restoration of quantity from non-
iambic words like Ρῑόνό, etc. Substantially all the “ common '’ vowels
in final syllables may be thus explained. The iambic law affects amiis
and amdnt as well as amb.

There is in this play one probable instance (fabris, 131) of the
iambic shortening through the mute and liquid group. This shorten·
ing is rare.

In the text of this edition the classical usage is taken as the stand-
ard. Thus, as in the variation of the ᾶγηᾶε and Ρῐόνᾶε types, amiis
became the fixed type, cases oi αἠιᾶε must be indicated. Conversely,
ἄφηᾶι versus plorat yielded plorat, and instances of plorc'it amdt are
indicated. The “ common '⁹ vowels are marked only when long.

Examples of the iambic shortening in Act 1., scene 1, of our play
are abi (fourth conJ‘ugation imperative), 8, 66 3 eri (genitive singular
second declension)‚ 21, which involve syllables long by nature; and
lubet, 20, which involves a syllable long by position. In 42, ὄῑὲνο, by
elision oi its final e, becomes dissyllabic and yields bler', and in 73, by
a similar elision, moleste est yields molest’ esc.

(2) Two monosyllables, with a quantity value u — , suffer a simi-
lar reduction to Qu : e.g. quid est in 69, quid ᾰ (1012). The second
monosyllable is not infrequently the preposition of a compound verb
mihi exhibent (565), or noun, or in some cases even a syllable not a
preposition, but liable to be confounded with one (see note on 24,
and cf. uel optumo, 410).

(3) 'l'risyllables oi cretic quantity (-υ-) are now and then
shortened in song measures (ς 20 ff.) to dactyls (— ψυ), e.g. in 347,
7843 cf. also ire uis (878). This shortening is sometimes ascribed to
the iambic law. Note also senecta, 217.

(4) Quadrisyllables, with a quantity value u--2‚ also suf-
fer a pyrrhic change in their initial iambic group, yielding unz-s).-
The probable cause was the secondary stress on the initial syllable.
This change rarely, if ever, affected a syllable long by nature. An
example in Act I.‚ scene 1, is iuuentute, 30.
