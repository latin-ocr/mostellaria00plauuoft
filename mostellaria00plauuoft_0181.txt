where Tranio had been since he went down the alley at 687.

it is easy to make it the (virtual) object of impetratum (supine), sup-
plied from the participle impetratum.

haps causal = ideo, idcirco ,· ‘ causal ' id is on the same footing as the
causal relative quod ‚· see note on 69, and cf. with the example there
cited Amph. 909, et id (= ad eam rem, as in 759 above) huc reuerti,
