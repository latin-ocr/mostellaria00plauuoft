also Psalms 90. 5, ‘⁶ In the morning they are like grass which groweth
up. Ι In the morning it flourishe'th and groweth up; Ι In the evening
it is cut down and withereth.'' We may interpret the proverb, how-
ever, in the sense of Herrick's lines, “ Gather ye rosebuds while ye
may Ι Old Time is still a-fiying.'‘ That the sententia was somewhat
obscurely expressed the following question shows.

161. For similar quips, cf., e.g.‚ I. Kiny Henry I V. I. ii. 50: “ And
is not mine hoscess os the caverit a most sweet wench i> :z . . . And is
not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?:: . . . What a
plague have I to do with a buff jerkin ? :z Why, what a pox have I
to do with my hostes-3 os che tavern ? '’ Cf. also Love's Labor's Lost,
V. ii. 19. Venus uenusta: note the pleonasm‚ ξ 79. 8. The
speech of Philolaches that begins here continues in the spirit of the
soliloquy just ended.

162. haec: refers to Philematium as she advances on the stage3
see ξ 48. 1. mihi . . . detexit: conti-ast with detexit a me, in 140,
and see note on isti, 235; detexit (163) comes froin deceyo, not from
decemo.

163-164. Amor et Cupido . . . perpluit: cf. from Kipling's
Recessionaz, “The tumult and the shouting dies,'' and see, for the
concord, ξ 59. 3. meum: pleonastic after mihi,· cf. ξ 79. 2, and
see note on tu, 16.

165. madent . . . parietes: repeats (parietes) peu-plumat from
111. oppido: see note on 136. haec . . . aedis: cf. haec

liqna, 146, and general note (2) on Act I. Scene ii. ; for the form of
haec, see ξ 48. 2.

166. amabo: for the tense, see ξ 71. 1. satin: see note on 76.
deceat: indirect question3 see ἓ 66. 2, and the note on 149.

167. Philolachi: for the form, see ς 44. ocello: opple of my
eye (ᾖ 4Ο; ξ 88. 2).

168. moribus lepidis . . . lepida: pleonastic (see ξ 79. 5).
tute's: on 's for es, see § 37. 3.

169. non uestem . . . fartim: if this sentiment seems coarse in
the antique, contrast with it the superior modern tone of “when a
man praises your clothes, he always is praising you in them ” (Lillian
Bell's From a Girl's Ροίηε os View, p. 29). fartim : concencs; lit-
erally, fillium· this noun, not elsewhere found in Latin, was perhaps
a ⁸ momentaneous ' coinage (cf. ᾖ 42), patterned on satim in aclfizcim
edere, ⁴ to eat to one’s fill.’
