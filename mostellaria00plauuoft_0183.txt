quip, playing upon the special sense of sui (see ἓ 71. 2) ; cf. As You
Like It, 111. iv. 31, “ You have heard him swear downright he was z:
⁴ Was’ is not ⁴ is.’ '⁹

822. emeras: did you say you paid ,· see note on 496.

824. qui: ‘asseverative’ qui (see Lewis and Short, Lac. Dict.
s.v. 2 qui, II. C.) probably originated from exclamatory phrases in
which qui multum, e.g., would mean ‘how much 1 ’ whence, as here,
ever so much ‚· cf. note on nivnis quam, 511. multum improbiores:
with the comparative, multo and other adverbs of ablative derivation
are the rule in Plautus, but sporadic cases are not to be changed3 cs.

Livy (v. 21. 14), and Cicero, de Or. iii. 92.

825. ab intumo z perhaps referring in the equivoque to the gouty
feet of the old men. tarmes: a teredo, yrub .· tarmes is a play
upon the etymological significance of Tranio's own name (see note on
Personae), a play continued in subsequent verses.

826. intempestiuos: cf. Virgil, θεον-9. i. 256 (conuenit, ‘it’s
advisable’), tempestiuam siluis euertere (‘fell') pinum ,· Lorenz
quotes Pliny (N. Η. 16, ξ 189) to this effect, ‘wood cut in spring
suffers from borers, but winter-cut timber is not so damaged, nor does
it crack.’ Curiously enough, wood cut according to the directions
given by Pliny (l.c.)‚ and put in the temple erected by Augustus
in honor of Mars Ultor, was found in a state of excellent pres-
ervation as late as the 16th century (Thedenat‚ Le Forum Romaiu,
p. 219).

827. si eunt inducti: is (only) the pillars are smeared, but equiv-
ocally‚ {f che two old scicks are led on,· 35:35 modo, as in 247.
pice: with puch, but by equivoque = a pico, ‘by a picus? Tranio-
picus to wit. It is by this passage, perhaps, that we should interpret
the gloss pica κίσσα καὶ πίσσα, ⁴ magpie and pitch.’

828. pultflagus: pov-ridge-eacinffi a hybrid from palti -l- Greek
φάγος, ‘ eating.’ barbarus: soreiqner‚ Roman ‚· Plautus is supposed
to have introduced gage like this for the Roman audience, as a min-
strel troupe would speak of bean-eaters in Boston. Possibly, however,
these gags crept in in Sicily or in Magna Graecia, where a Roman
element was to be found in the audience. But the allusion possibly
belonged to the Attic original, for the comic poet Hermippus (Kock,
63), ca. 432 Β.ο., mentions χόνδρος (the grits from which puls was
made) in a list oi imports from Italy. On the other hand, Ussing’s
