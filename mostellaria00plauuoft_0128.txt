nacle cometh quickly'' (2 Peter 1. 14); “if all life and 'sense shall
cease, then shalt thou cease also . . . to serve and tend this vile cot-
tage’' (Casaubon's Meditatt'ons of Marcus Aurelius, III. 3). More

 

modern examples are Χίης] John, 111. iii. 20, “Within this wall of ,

fiesh Ι There is a 80111 00111118 11166 1161 creditor'' ; Dryden's Absalom
and Achitophel‚ 156 f. : “ A fiery soul, which, working out its
way, Ι Fretted the pigmy body to decay Ι And o'erinformed the tene-
ment of clay.'’

Now this symbolism may not appeal to us, and it is very long drawn
out, but we can hardly deny to the parable, qua parable, >considerable
literary merit. The speaker's penitential exhibition of his own mis-
conduct, albeit maudlin, must have awaked sympathy in his audience;
and his language more than 01106 has the true poetic ring.

(3) This long parable is not alien to the subject-matter of the play.
Nay, to an age like ours, that has had its Wagner, the subject of the
monody, ‘ house,' might pass for the leit-motis of the entire play, which
turns indeed, as the sequel will show, upon ‘house' We might. com-
pare Bulwer's ‘Poodle-1notif,' in What will He clo with Ic, Book ΙΙΙ.

(4) STAGE 1308111688.- If the parable is long, yet there was relies in
118 being suny (ἓξ 11, 20) —and perhaps danced—to music. It would
be not inconsistent with the situation, so far as we know it, to place
above this long monody the words Air de Ballet, Pas de l’Ensant
Prodiyue. The actor upon the stage may have only gesticulated (or

danced) to the music, while a singer behind the scenes rendered the ⁴

song (cf. Livy, vii. 2. 8 ff). The possession of the musical score would
be of great service for the interpretation of the monody, and particu-
larly for its metrical arrangement. With this lost musical score
in our hands we might know whether the more obvious and tedicus
repetitions of thought and word had a place in the original text of
the song.

(5) ann. -This long solo clearly falls into a stanzaic arrange-
ment of five divisions. For a detailed statement of the measure of
each verse, see the schemes before the notes on 85, 105, 120, 133, 149.

Stanza 1, verses 85-104. —This stanza introduces the similitude
which the parable is to expand, viz. : the likeness between a man and
a house, and proceeds as far as the building of the house. The melre
is bacchiac-iambic, ending in two long iambic verses.
