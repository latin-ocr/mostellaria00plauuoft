PAGE 4] ACT 1. SCENE 1. 69

occasionally introduces an apodosis. hocine 'uolebasz is this what
you were itchinq sor ? The tense is adapted to the emotiou of Grumio,
not to Tranio's recognition of it ; for the form of hocine, see ς 48. 2.
perii: for the tense, see § 71. 2. qur . . . uerberas: spelling ex-
plained in ἓξ 34. 5, 35.

11. quia uiuis: like a child's ‘because‘ patiar: sc. id quod
sacis. sine adueniat . . . sine uenire: for adueniat, see § 68;
for the shift, see ξ 76. 1.

, 12. saluom: spelling explained in 536. absentem comes: a
play on est, ‘ is,' and est (edit), ‘eats’3 for the. sense of comes, cf.
Cicer0, ad Atc. vi. 1. 25, putat enim suos nummos uos comedisse.

13. frutex: render by serub (§ 88), the degraded form of ‘shrub ‘
(cf. ‘ serub-oak ’).

14. comesse: with equivocal meanings‚ ιο be with and to devour.
The whole of 14 is an expanded echo— with the usual note of protest
——of absentem comes (12). possiet: for form and construction,
see ἓξ 55, 67. 3 ; might also be explained as the verb of an explana-
tory zet-clause (ς 69. 2), depending on uerum.

15. urbanus: an ironical compliment to the petted city domestic.
scurra ε clandy. deliciae popli : universal pet or popular favorum

tion, ὸς] and by. tradier: for the form, see ἓ 57, and for the
tense, ἕ 72. 2.

18. cis . . . paucas tempestates = incra paucos dies; archaic,
and perhaps meant to be elegant. The common people—witness the
southern darkies — exhibit a fondness for long words and an affectation
of elegance in diction no less than the learned.

19. genus ferratile ε che chain-qany, ιο wit ,· on ferratile, see §42-

22. pergraecaminei: on the spelling (ei for ῐ), see 536. ὃς in
sense peryraecaminec probably forms a climax with bibite. ,¹ the Latin
glossary of Paulus-Festus defines by epulis et potationibus inseruire.
With this we may compare Cicero, Verres, ii. 1. 66, fic . . . ιἠιιίιαιὶο uc
