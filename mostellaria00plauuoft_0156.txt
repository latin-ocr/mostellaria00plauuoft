104 NOTES. [Pron 19

375. ualet illequidem: he's a qood boy enou9h; uale and salue
form a staple subject for quips (eg. Asin. 592). disperii: drunk-
enly repeated as bis peristi .· there may be a conscious clement of de-
risive mockery, however, in the connection 3 cf. Pseud. 235, at ε : bam
Persa, 212, heia :z beia,· Stich. 771, babae z: tatae :z papae ,· ibid. 749,
totus doleo : ι potus? tanto miserior. For all this there may still be an
underlying consciousness of the etymological identity of bis and dis
to prompt the quip; cf. Cas. 974, where dismarite doubtless has the
underlying idea of bis marite.

37¹7. i iube abire: a ruder repetition of ualeat pater ‚· for the
omitted subject, see ξ 72. 1. quid . . . reditio . . . fuit: see note
on 6. etiam: ayain,· a little pleonastic with red-icio‚· cf. the
phrase etiam atque etiam, ‘again and again.'

378. me . . . miserum: me, his poor boy.

380. igitur demum: see note on iyicur tum, 132. This proverb
has the force of ours about ‘locking the door after the steed is stolen.'
An alleged Chinese proverb gives an inverted turn for this: “dig a
well before you are thirsty.'’ Ovid, wis-tia, i. 3. 35, expresses the
idea by clipeum (‘ shield ’) post vulnera sumo.

381. sicut: render by so, introducing the application of the
proverb. nunc z iam demum. ·

382. eccere autem: cf. MileS, 207, followed in 209 by ecce autem,
without appreciable difference.

383. etiam: possibly interrogative (§73. 1. 2), though it might
mean‘ again) as in 377. ain tu: you don' c say!

385. perdis rem : we have the converse phrase, ⁴ to save the situa-
tion.' rem : vague (cf. 199), but perhaps stands for rem nostram =
‘nos (ᾗ 80). abripite : addressed to mute servants standing by.

386. matula z matella ,· a Greek parallel of 386 is Epicrates, 5. 4,
τί ’γὰρ Ι ἔχθιον ἢ ιπαῖ παῖ’ καλεῖσθαι παρὰ πότον Ι καὶ ταῦτ’ ἀγενείῳ
μειρακυλλίῳ τινί, Ι ἢ τὴν ἀμίδα φέρειν, etc. ; Cf. also Diphilus, 43, 34.

387. Note how the sels-reliant' slave comes to the help of his young
master, a timid and resourceless young gentleman, after the type of
the Graeco-Roman stage. medicabo : I'll doctor.

388. nullus sum: varying perii (ξ 71. 2.) ego . . . medita-
bor: I’ll fix you up a sedative prescrz‘lm‘on‚· qui . . . sedem has the
construction of qui oblinam in 258.

389. satin habes: arc you quite satisfiech· cf. Amph. 509, and
Livy, v. 21. 9. ita . . . faciam . . . ne: (uc) ne is the general
