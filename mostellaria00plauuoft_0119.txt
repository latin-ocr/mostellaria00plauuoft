of the entire play, the student is referred to the synopses introducing
the scenes of each act, viz. before the notes on 1, 85, 157, 313; 348,
407; 431, 532, 689, 783; 858, 885, 904, 933, 993 ; 1041, 1064, 1122.

This scene introduces us to two of our dramatis personae. Tranio
is the leading character of the play. In this scene he is chidden for
having led his young master along the downward path to ruin, and
threatened with vengeance upon the return of his old master. Grumio,
who chides him, is a sturdy country slave, loyal to his old, and devoted
to his young, master, whose dissipations he plainly characterizes‚ but
lays the blame for them on Tranlo. ·

(3) Commium. -Dramatically the scene takes the place of >a pro-
logue, sketehing in the circumstances that precede the critical moment,
and foretelling the return of old master to set young master to rights,
and bring Tranio, his seducer, to book.

Grumio leaves the stage at the end of the scene to return no more.
A more provident playwright might have used him to great purpose
in unmasking Tranio and egging on his old master to punish his
wicked fellow-slave. We find a similar dramatic lavishness in Epi-
dicuS, Aet Ι. sc i. ; while in the Trinummus Megaronides (Act I. sc. i. ’
and ii.) appears again as a makeshift in Act ΙΙΙ. sc. iii. · Terence also
employs a character of this kind, Geta by name, in the Phormio, I. i.

(4) Tua unanima of the scene is violent, rich in abusive epithets
(ς 88) and in oaths and ejaculations (ς 90).

(5) Marna—The scene is a Diverbium (ἓ 12), and written in
Iambic Senarii (ἐς 13, 14).

1. e culina: the kitchen, let us suppose, opened on the alley and
not on the street. sis = si uis (ἐξ 37. 2, 43), in ironica] courtesy.
foras: out os doors (ᾖ 46). mastigIa: rip, rapscallion; a quasi-
desiderative noun, and means ‘wanting the whip'; genuine Latinis
uerbera, with the same meaning3 for derivation and signification, see
§5 38, 88.

2. argutias: quipe, synonymous with facetiae, sales ,· for the num-
ber, cf. ξ 59. 1.

3. erilis: (younq) master's,· cf, §61.7. permittes: ruination
(ξ 41. 1); cf. Asi-n. 133, perlecebrae‚ permittes, adulescentum exicium,
and Pseud. 364. The verse cited lets us surmise that permities means
‘ruining by indulgence.’ It is perhaps a humorous perversion oi
