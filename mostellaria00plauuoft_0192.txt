ACT IV. SCENE 4.—VERSES 933-992.

(1) SrNoPS1s.—- In this scene Theopropides discovers the two body-
servants of Scenes 1 and 2 of this act trying to enter his house. In the
conversation that follows they unmask Tranio, and declare the story
of the haunted house a hoax.

(2) Mnrnn.-— Recitative (ἓ 15), trochaic septenarii (ἓὲ 18-19).

934. cantantem: playiny and sinyiny.

935. illisce: yon ‚· on the form, see ξ 48. 1.

936. pultare: for the construction, see ᾗ 72. 3.

937. etiamne: for the type of question, see ς 73. 3. fabula:
coup cle theatre, as in 510; as banging upon the door (899) was theatri-
cal clap-trap, so we have allusions like this to the general clap-trap of
plays; cf. Pseud. 1080, quid dicit tibi ? : ι theatri nuyas.

938. aduersum uenimus: cf. 313.

941. praefectus: probably, in the Greek original, an ἀστυνόμος,
one of a board charged, among other things, with the inspection of
houses in sanitary and other regards. Their duties corresponded in
part to a Roman censor's‚ also, for we read of their punishing one
Crates for appearing on the streets in muslin (Diogenes Laertius, ii.
5. 90) : cf. Aul. 504, moribus praesectum mulierum, on which Ussing
cites Cicero, Rep. iv. 16, uec uero mulieribus praefectus praeponatur,
qui apud Graecos creari solet ,· sed sit censor, qui uiros doceat moderari
umoribus. So in Trin. 990, there is no certainty that the noui aediles
mentioned were Roman officials at all ; they were probably ἀγορανόμοι
in the original, such as Dicaeopolis appointed in the Acharnians
(719 ff.) to guard his market, and furnished with whips to keep away
the sycophants, and it is curicus that it is precisely a sycophant who
is promised a beating (To-in„ Le.) at the hands of the new aediles.
The praefectus here mentioned corresponds with the official called
iurator in Trin. 871, quid, adulescens, quaeris 5³ quicl uis 9 quid,
istas pultes ? ι : heus senex, census quom sum, iuratori recte rationem
(ledi. nouos: uewly inductecl, perhaps3 but perhaps nouos has
the moral significance of ‘new' in our proverb, “new brooms sweep
clean.'’

943. an iam uendidit : for the tone of the question, see ξ 73. 2.

944. aut: introduces an alternative question, as in 466, 478, and
has its'usual excluding force.
