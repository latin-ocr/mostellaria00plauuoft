ΙΙΙ.
ΤΗΕ DIALEc'r OF PLAUTUS.

33. The Old Latin of Plautus's time differs from the
elassieal Latin¹ of Cicero in orthography, vocabulary, formS,
and syntax, to say nothing of stylistie differenees (see
summary in ἐξ 3-4).

1. ΟΜ) SPELmNes.

i. Involving consonante.

34. (1) Assimilation in compounds frequently does not take place,
e. g. ira—mimae, inridere, inponam (so also other prepositions) ;
-x- z -aes- in exercicem (663), exiliatis (1065).

(2) But Assimilation sometimes takes place, where it is omitted in
the Classical period, e.g. op-tz‘qere, opsequentem (ob-)‚ aps-tulit (abib),
etc.

(3) Initial 9⁷2- for n-, e.g. in ynacuS, classical natus. Medial -ss- for
-s-, eg. incusses (713).

(4) Final -d omitted in hausti), 735. Note also, in composition,
hauscio (783).

(5) Confusion of q and c, eg. qur (10), qum (148).

(6) Metathesis of r in accersunt (509)-beside arcesserem (1044).

1 Many of these differenees, however, are only apparent, resulting
from a disregard on the part of the editors of Cicero and later writers
of the spelling contemporary with these authors. In regard to the
forms and vocabulary of Plautus, it should also be borne in mind that
there is no comedy of the Classical period.
