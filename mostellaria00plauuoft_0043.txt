§6⁷1 THE DIALECT oF PLAUTUs. xxxix

(4) quom (cum), in all its senses, takes the indicative almost with-
out exception,—the subjunctive perhaps only by attraction—cf. 858,
quom culpa carent lamen malum metuont, ‘though free from fault,
yet are they fearful of ill.’ So dum, though expressing design, takes
the indicative (683, 687).

THE SUBJUNCTIVE.

67. Independent clauses. - (1) Positive and negative com-
mands: habeas (47), taceas (388) ; present subjunctive with negative:
ne . . . atliqalis (468), quid metuas (745), censeas (1005), postules
(1023); perfect subjunctive: ne occupassis (1097), nil me curassz's
(526).

(2) Ideal 2d person: see examples in ἓ 66. 2; cf., in a dependent
clause, quicquid imponas (782), ‘whatever one loads them with,’

The leontion, una opera . . . postules (258), ‘ you might aswell try,'
has developed from the fuller ideal conditional type represented by
Casina, 309, una opera (me) in furnum calidum condito (= condas),

qua opera impetres, ‘ as well put me into a red-hot furnace as try to Α

obtain.'

(3) Plautus uses the subjunctive with great freedom to echo previous
statements, questionS‚ commands, and wishes, whether expressed or
implied. The echoed phrase is almost always in interrogative form
and in the tone of indignant protest. We find the bare subjunctive, or
the sentence contains an interrogative -ne or ut (see note on 718), or
both combined. Examples are ;-.

α) 1016, quod filius neqoti gessit : : ul ille gesserit neyoti?,· Asi-na-
ria, 699, uehes pol hodie me, siquidem hoc arqentum serre speres ε : ten
eqo ucham? z: tun hoe feras amentum ?‚· Curculio, 615, uiryo haec
liberast :z mean ancilla libera ut sit? ; Menaechmi, 681, tibi dedi
equidem illam: : mihi lu ut dederis pallam 5³

b) 301, cur exprobras ⁸? z : eyone id exprobrem ?; Bacchides, 627 a,
non taces ‘2‘ 2: taceam ἱ) ; cf. Miles, 317, quid negotist: ε quid negoti sit
roqas θησαν non rogem? and Mostellaria, 906, ecquid placent? :2
ecquid placeant, me royas 5³, where the verb of asking is loosely
appended to the echo.

e) 579, abi : z abeam?; 374, ualeat pater, ‘my adieux to your
father,’ where valeat echoes the common formula nale ( paler).

d) 183, ica Ph. le amet l . . . : ε ita eqo islam amarem 1
