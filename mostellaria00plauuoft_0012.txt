116 used two or more Greek plays to furnish the material for
one Latin play, we might regard him rather as an adapter.
This view is supported by the occurrence of purely Roman
allusione, ——not very numerous in the Mostellaria, —and by
his wealth of quips, ‘ gags,⁷ and puns.

he ranges widely, disdaining not to borrow from the
