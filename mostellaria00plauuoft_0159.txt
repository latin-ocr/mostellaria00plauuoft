PAGE 22] Aer 11. SCENE 2. 107

415. et: the postponement of et in its clause is remarkable, but
not unparalleled; cf. Horace, Sat. i. 4. 68, at bene si quis Ι et uiuat
puris mambae, etc. After all, if we had in Horace proueniantque
sine malo, we should supply another proueniant for tranquille (cf.
Smith’s Ode-s os Horace, ἓ 119. b). The following examples will show
clauses where a word necessary for construction before et. does not
occur till after it. Aeneid, iv. 351, me patris Anchisae (sc. imayo)

. . admonet in somnis et turbida terret imayo ‚· ibid. vi. 640, laryior
hic campos aether (sc. uestit), et lumine uestit pumureoe Juvenal, vii.
182-183, parte a'lia lonyis Numidarum sulca columnis Ι sumat (sc.
cenacto), et alyentem raptat cenatio solem.

416. sicut: cf. 381. quae: the antecedent is the following
omnia. quae . . . turbauimue: the scorm I have raised.

419. quid . . . egredere: Tranio is so lost in admiration of him-
self as a philosopher that he has torgotten the order he gave in 404.
iamiam: sels-corrective, like immo in 3353 cf. Gu-rc. 230, quis hic est
homo 2³ . . . iamiam noui.

420. iussit: the natural subject erus is omitted (ξ 60), but Roman
servants used ipse, ipsa, ‘ he, she,’ for ⁶ master, mistress,' and perhaps
the mere verb-termination is so used here. In our vernacular ‘he ’
and ‘she’ mean, in the mouth of common people, ‘husband’ and
‘ wife’ ; in the mouth of servants, their employers3 in the mouth of
children, their school teachers.

42].. maxumo opere: this locution was by no means reduced to
a fixed order in Plautus 3 see 752, and cf. note on tanto opere, 525.

423. etiam: ayaz'n, as in 377.

424. capite obuoluto: cf. 523, and note.

427-428. ludos . . . faciam: this locution means ‘ to play tricks
on,’ and generally takes the accusative (see note on Aryumentum, 7) 3
here, however (but cf. Mero. 225, Rud. 594, and, with a slight differ-
ence, Truc. 759), to prepare for the equivoque, it means, ‘to give
public games in honor of,' and we have the dative. The funeral games
were more particularly a Roman institution, and Plautus, unless we
advance the theory of an epic reminiscence in the Greek original, here
introduces a bit of local color; cf. Amph. 450, uiuo fit (sc. imaqo,
‘bust') quod nunquam quisquam mortuo saciet mihi, where imayo is

ς certainly2a Romant allusion.

 

429. concedam . . . huc: in a modern play such material would
generally appear as a stage direction 3 cf. Act 1. Scenes 1 and 3 (end).
