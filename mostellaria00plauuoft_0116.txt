opening scene of our play); ln both plays Grumio gets a beating
(cf. Shrew, Ι. ii. with the opening lines of the Mostellaria); in our
play Tranio's chief dramatic business is to beguile his old master ⁴and,
then to fall into an altercation with him, and in the Shrew (V. i.)
Tranio comes into violent quarrel with his old master; the rapturos
of Philolaches when his lady-love appears upon the stage (Ι, iii.) are
not unlike Lucentio's raptures at the first sight of Bianca (Shreuu
I. i.). With these coincidences before us, we may well believe that .
the Mostellaria, through an acting version, was an explicit source of
our own great· dramatist’s Taminy of the Shrew.

PERSONAE.

A large proportion oi our characters have tell-tale names, most os
which retain their original Greek form.

Tranio: etymologically cognate with τετραίνει, ⁴ pierces,' and specifi-
cally derived from τρανής, with a by-form τρανός, which was an epithet
of the god Hermes as the interpreter and revealer (cf. Cornutus,
N .D. 16: πρῶτον μὲν διάκτορος κέκληται, ἤτοι ἀπὸ τοῦ διάκτορος εἶναι καὶ
τρανός). The adverb τρανῶς is used by Aeschylus and Euripides with
verbs of saying, showing, and learning, and these complexes mean
⁴ to reveal ’ or ⁴ to have revealed.' In our Latin version there is more
than one play on the name of Tranio in its remoter etymological sense
of ⁴ piercing’ (see notes on 825, 903, 984); while as a sort of Hermes,
the revealer, Tranio is identified with the Roman prophet-king, the
personified picus, ‘wood—pecker' (see notes on 514, 667, 1103, 1113);
again, harking back to the remoter etymology, Tranio is likened unto
the actual wood-pecker (picus), and perhaps even to the magpie
(pica, see notes on 5, 65, 827, 835, 11153 and cf. Nonius, 518, 31,
Picumnus et auis est Marci dicata, quam picum uel picam uocant, et
deus qui sacris Romanis adhibetur). Abbreviated Tr.

Grumioz (flod, Glodhopper‚ is suggested as a rendering ; cs. yrumus,
defined by Latin glosses1 as comestio pulueris, ‘heap of dust’ (see
note on 40). Abbreviated Gr.

Philolaches: the significance of the name is not clear. Abbrevi-
ated Pl.

Philematium: Kissy. Abbreviated Pm.
