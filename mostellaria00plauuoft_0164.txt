112 No'rsss [Pion 25

489. an: hoping for a negative answer (see ἓ 73. 2). st: hist;
the signal for silence carries with it the note of the weird, the un-
canny. Tranio hushes his voice in a mock fright.

491. nempe ergo: why, os course; reassuring himself while he
asks the question, as our word ‘ doubtless⁷ often betrays doubt; ‘of
course’ is an etymological rendering of erqo ‚· cf. e racione, ‘straight
along,' and crya, ‘ towards) ita: here an affirmative (ἓ 91).

492. This verse continues to retard the story.

493. quin: why noc ,· best rendered after mirum by that not.

494. abhinc: ayo,· here only in Plautus with an ablative. foret:
see ξ 71. 7.

495. inepte stultus: on the pleonasm‚ see ἓ 79. 5; such freedom
of language from a slave to his master is surprising‚ but accorded with
Greek custom (cf. also 635, 1094).

496. ecce: lo! though calling most often for attention from the
eye, may demand it as well from the ear or mind ; cf. Laberius (in
Ribbeck 2), 104, ecce, in senecta uc facile labefecit loco . . . oratio.
dixerat: he said he (the ghost) said ,· not a case of pluperfect as a
mere narrative tense 3 in alluding to a past statement dixeram is used
where in our idiom priority cannot be indicated3 eg. in Brutus, 157
(cf. also de Or. i. 197), Atticus says to Cicero dixeram a principio,
alluding to a statement made before in 11, and dixeram is prior to
what was said in the interval (cf. 5 71. 6) ; particularly instructive is
the following (Cicero, ad. Quint. ii. 3. 2), where, after interdum,
breaking up the interval into lesser periods, the tense changes: qui
uc peronzan—nam in eo sane fortis fuit . . . dixit omnia, acque
interdum eciam silentio, cum auctoritate pereqerat—. . . surrexit
Clodius.

497. transmarinus : merely Diapontius turned into Latin.

499. Acheruntem : the place of the dead 3 for the construction,
see note on Aeyypco, 440, and for the quantity, ς 0. 4. From the con·
sequences to which this verse and the next allude, Queen Dido (Aen.
iv. 696 ff.) was relieved by Juno.

500. per fidem (sc. meam) ε by my very confidence in him, or, by
natural inference, ιή υίοῑαιίοη os his loyalcy to me. Lorenz compares
Cicero, Verr. ii. 5. 100, qui . . . per hospicium exhausit, ‘who in the
name of friendship sucked him dry.‘

501-502. hic . . . in hisce aedibus: pleonastic (§ 79. 1-2), much
as me . . . me in 201-202. defodit insepultum z it was not allos
