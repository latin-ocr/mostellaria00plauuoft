ς 20] VERSIFICATION. xxi

In at least one additional 0380 (976) the diaeresis after the fifth foot
excuses hiatus (and syllaba anceps).

(3) The primary diaeresis in the fifth foot, without a supporting
secondary diaeresis, occurs in eight verses (294, 306, 311, 927, 1071,
1127, 1144, 1167, = ,02 ÷) ; e.g. :—

6 υ - ,ε - ,ς - .’ - ‚¹ - -’ υ υ Δ

mela.

(4) Further cases are 1) diaeresis after second and fifth (368, 816,
842, 1181) ; 2) caesura‘in the fourth foot (1130, 1170) ; 3) diaeresis after
the second with caesura iu the fourth 1001 (911) 3 4) caesura in the
third with diaeresis after the fifth (371, 941); 5) caesura in the fourth
and diaeresis after the fifth (987, 1064, 1135); 6) diaeresis after the
third and fourth (1172, 1175) ; 7) diaeresis 31101· 1110· third and caesura
in the sixth (370); 8) diaeresis after the third and sixth (377, 946);
9) in 908 we have a caesura in the fourth with a diaeresis (and elision,
ς 14) after the fifth, as in no. 5), in this section.

(5) In the trochaie septenarii, as well as in the iambic (see ς 17. 1),
the regularity of the diaeresis after the fourth foot is so great that it
often seems to separate (and bind) words of the closest syntactical
connection3 e.g. in ε Ι aedibus (402) shows separation of a preposition
and its noun ; in 404 the group harunc: Ι aedium is separated by diaere-
sis. The separation of the preposition of a compound verb seems also
admissible (01. 989, comi Ι satum ab :lisse). The apparent harsh-
11088 11010 is relieved by taking into account the musical aeoompani-
ment. Further, the frequent shortening by the iambic law (ἓ 6, 2)
01 a preposition thus prefixed to a verb shows how far from fixed eom-
position was felt 10 be, and so does the varying synizesis in compounds.

20. The sung part of 3 Plautine Comedy shows a great
variety of cola. By colon we are to understand a musical
phrase, or rhythmie unit unbroken by caesural pause. The
Mostellaria has the following song parts: —

1) A long solo, 85-156.

2) A ehoral divided between four singers, 313-347.
