tal and s10w‚ as his long 1nonody has made us, and so she interjects her
household directions between the members of-l1is antithesis.

307. accumbe: calce your place. puere : to a slave in the
house, not necessarily young3 see the remarks of the elderly Greek
slave cited in the note on 386 ; on the form, see 545. mensulam:
see note on arculam, 248. These preparations for a banquet‚ com-
mon in Graeco-Roman comedy, will be already known to the stu-
dent from the Odes of Horace.

308. prosus commod-is :'(such) entirely conyenial souls (as ours) ‚·
cf. Poen. 615, conuiuas uolo reperire *nobis commodos (‘conge11ial ’) ; in
Pseud. 443, homines commodi means ‘ considerate men.’ For the sen-
timent of verses 306 and 308, compare a similar but more magnanimous
sententia addressed to the audience in Persa, 777, bene ei qui inuidet
mihi, et ei qui hoc qaudet.

309. tali : not from calis (ξ 43). uin: for the form, see ς 37. 4.

AoT 1. SCENE 4.—vERsns 313-347.

(1) Trm &nummus—The oncoming characters, introduced to
us at the end of the previous scene as Philolaches had been introduced
by Grumio at the end of Scene 1 (compare how Philolaches in 161 f.
gave a somewhat belated introduction of the new characters), are
Callidamates, boon companion to Philolaches, accompanied by Del-
phium, his amica.

(2) Srnopsis. —- The whole of Act I., of which this is the last scene,
is concerned with the exposition of the ribald life of Philolaches,
under the promptings and with the connivance of Tranio. This scene
exhibits the drunken Callidamates on h'is way to the banquet that was
being set forth in the last scene. The banquet showed all the more
dissipation by coming before noon (cf. 579, 651).

(3) Sum: Busmnss. —The drunken business of the scene, so far as
the words can show it, is aeknowledged on every hand to be admi-
rable ; it may be compared with the drunkeuness of Chivy in the play
of David Garrick.
