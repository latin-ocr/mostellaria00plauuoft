322. amplectare: for the construction, see § 68.

324. duce: for the form, see § 56.

325. ho-ho-hocellus: see note on 3193 ocellus is defined in note
on 167.

325 b. alumnus: pet. mel meum: muh homey (in negro dia-
lect) ; one of the commonest pet names (ξ 88).

326. accubas : fall down,· contrast with accumbe in 308 (ἓ 51).

327. illi: we should expect illo, ‘ yonder‚' but ubi has perhaps
exer-ted an attraction. colimus: an elision within a compound
(see §7- 2). For the dramatic situation, cf. Persa, 765, sed amabo,
oculus meus, quin lectis nos actutum commendamus φ

328 ab. sine sinc: this repetition continues the stammering effect.
It the lengthened ending may not be explained as due to the ictus, —-
that is to say, a musical lengthening controlled by the conductor's
batam—we may think of the analogy of pairs like cene tene, mane
mane (Aul. 415, 655). desino . . . in manunt: I yive it up, sor
(see ξ 74. 3) I 'm sicle os (fetet) the matter in hand ; hoc quod mihi in
manusc (cf. 594) is the intention expressed in 317 ; we might punctu-
ate desino (fetet) hoc etc., thus bringing out the fact that the phrase
which is the subject of secet is the virtual object of desino ‚· with secet,
‘ I'm sick of,’ cf. Cas, 727, cited in the note on 38, and, for the meta-
phot, Hamlet, ΙΙΙ. iii. 36, “ My offence is rank, it smells to heaven.''
We may interpret these words, however, by imagining a little stage
business, to mean, 1 'll yive up here .· che (bottle os) wine I have in my
hand invites me with its smell ,· an obJ'ect held in the hand may be
called hoc, irrespective of its grammatical gender‚ e.g. aula, ‘pot,' is
called hoc at Aul. 449, and at Stich. 762, hoc seems to mean a can-
charus.

333. tene: sc. eam (ς 63. 8). age i simul: come, move along).

334. quod: archaic for quo (ἓ 50. 2) ; the -d is identical with the
·cl in prod-it, red-it, ‘ goes forwards, backwards,' and perhaps cognate
with the enclitic Greek preposition -δε, ‘-wards.' Further instances
of quod, ‘whither,' all altered by the editors, are to be found at

Asin. 1253 Miles, 974; Trin. 628. an scis: suspeeting his own
ignorance and assuming Delphium’s (see 5 73. 2). acio: ves, Ι
do know‚· here Callidamates recovers his wits. modo: with tem-

poral force (ς 43).
335. nempe, etc. : os course ,ἡ continuing the seli-correction, and
ludicrously inconsistent with the assertion of 317. immo: nam a
