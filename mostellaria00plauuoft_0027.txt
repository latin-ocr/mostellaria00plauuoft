ς 26] VERsmmA'rroN OF PLAUTUS. xxiii

24. cola of {2 Time.¹——Plautus also employs cola of {-
time in his songs. These cola are the Bacchiac and the
Cretic.

, (1) Bacchiae (υ Lx) G'ola consist of two bacchiaOS, the
last of which enjoys the privileges of hiatus and syllaba
anceps.

(2) Cretic (L υ a) Οοῖα are similarly constructed of two
cretics. .

25. cola of {- 'rime (= diiambic and ditrochaie).

In song measures the units ss υ ,’.’ υ and u Δ ψ ss2 may be
regarded as, under conditions not yet well defined, interchangeable.

This means that we have musical bars of 6s5 time which suffer synco-

pations (i.e. accentual inversions) of many sorts. *Hence result the

following varieties z — — υ -’ v ditrochee,

υ - υ ... diiambus.

.- υ υ - choriambus.

υ - - υ (P) antispast.

υ υ - - ionic a minore.

- - ψ υ ionic a maiore.
- .- - molossus.

The exact substitution of two short syllables sor any long, as well
as the irrational substitution of a long or two shorts for a short,
occur. Occasionally also a cretio (- Q -) and a bacchiac (ψ - -)
are found with prolongation (i.e. ι- U - and u ι--).

Two such feet are generally combined, giving us a colon of eight
or more syllables.

26. 'l'he Thymelicus. —A foot called the waymelicus
occurs in certain combinations (ξ 31, 8-9), and may be
classed as a ᾖ time colon ( = L ψ υ ψ L).

¹ In the cola of §4 and 95 time a short is sometimes lengthened
(ag. 328, 890).

2 The symbol g is used for the secondary ictus. The chief ictus
of the ditrochee is on the lst long, of the diiambus on the 2d long.
In combination with their substitutes the stronger ictus of these meas-
ures is often hard to determine.
