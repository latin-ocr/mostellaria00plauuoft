90 NOTES. [Pacu 12

afterward by married women (see Miles, 791 ). In our time the change
from girl to ‘young lady ' is also marked by a change in the head-
dress.

22'7. exin: accordinyly ,· confined to early Latin. In the sente-ntia
(ξ 86) of 227 cause and effect seem to be inverted. In the next verse
the sententia is but a different form of Iago's “ Who steals my purse
steals trash,'' etc.

229. uenibit: aeneo serves as passive to nendo, cf. pereo : perdo.
potius quam: never pocius quam ut, as later (but see note on facilius
quam ut, 1170) ; always with the subjunctive in Plautus. Of two alter-
native courseS‚ potius quam introduces the course that is rejected.
Similarly, in alternative causal clauses, the rejected cause, introduced
by non quod (quia), normally takes the subjunctive. This is not be-
cause of any subtle affinity of the subjunctive for rejection, but a non
quod clause takes the sub-oblique subjunctive, as it rejects another’s
suggestion ; similarly a potius quam clause continues a dilemma in
which the alternative courses of action stood in the deliberative sub-
junctive, and the rejected alternative has no reason to readJ‘ust its
mood3 thus, here the imaginary dilemma was uendam patrem an te
sinam eyere ? to which the answer came, venibit pater potius quam
sinam.

230. me uiuo : on the ablative absolute in Plautus see ᾗ 64. 5.

231. illis: probably dative (see note on tibi, 202), but possibly
ablative (cf. me, 1166).

232. benemerenti: see note on beneuolentem‚ 195, and cf.
Oapc. 9:²35; Rud. 1391, addecet bene merenti bene referre qratiam.

233. mortuos pater: more concrete than ‘mors patris ‚· cf. note
on 433 ; on the spelling of mortuos, see ς 36. 1.

234. exheredem faciam: I 'll disinherit; eaeheredem takes the
genitive in Bacch. 849.

235. isti: the dative of the loser is as normal Latin as the dative
of the recipient. quidem: the position is unusual, but not un-
paralleled3 e.g. Cape. 789, conlecto quidemst pallio ,· Miles, 634, nam
benisynz'tas quidem huius oppido adulescentulisc. Cf. also Cicero, ad
Fam. v. 16. 2, est autem consolatio pervulyaca quidem illa maxime,
quam semper in ore . . . habere debemus ,· further examples in ad
Λιε. xv. 13. 5 ; Orat. 13. estur, bibitur : for the voice, see ξ 52.

236. sagina planest: ies reqular yormandizinq (a downriqht
seed) ; here saqz'na means ‘stuffing' ; cf. note on 65.
