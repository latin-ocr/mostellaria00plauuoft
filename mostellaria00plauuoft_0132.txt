80 N OTES. [PAen 7

120. primumdum: for -dum, see §410 4. liberum: for the
form, see §45, and note in the next verse liberorum (ξ 3. α).

121. ei z i; see §48. 2.

122. extollunt, parant: sc. eos (ἓ 63. 8). in firmitatem: sor
solidity.

123. in usum . . . in speciem: both useful and 0r⁴namental,· in
usum for usu-i (cf. sumptui, 125) is used to balance in speciem, regular
for speciei, the forms in -iei not being current in Latin.

124. materiae: contrast, for construction, with operam in 104.
In sense, materia, ‘timber,' is better suited to the actual house—building
than to its present parabolic application to reat-ing the boy ;> we may
render by a general term like the requisites.

125. sumptus ibi = arqentum quod in eis sumpserunt: with this
use of ibi (ξ 50. 1) cf. Terence, Adelph. 867, quam ibt (=cum ea
muliere) miseriam uidi! ducunt: count.

126. expoliunt, docent: they have them hithy cultivated, yivivzy
them Zessons in, etc. Note the causative implication, not uncommon
for Latin simple verbs, on the lines of the legal maxim qui facit per
alium facit per se. This verse and the next itemize the expenses
mentioned in 125.

128. nituntur ut, etc.: in αη effert to yet others to try,· a par-
allel for nitor ut in Merc. 111, nitere erus ut minor opera tua seruetur.
sibi esse . . . similes: repeated from 104. expetant: causative
like expoliunt in 126. ἢ

129. ad legionem: ordinarily the father of the Graeco-Roman
comedy was averse to his son’s going to the wars. Here we seem to
have a lingering literary tradition of honorable military service.
adminiclum: we are reminded of literary instances like Sinon,
squire to Palamedes (see Aeneid‚ ii. 86). danunt: archaic for dant
(see ξ 51); final twelve times in verse or colon (see §3. a ; and cf.
557), not final, Persa, 256.

130. tum iam ε thereupon, at the last; cf. hic iam in 107, and the
common group nuncic'im, eg. in 436; note the postponement of tum
iam (cf. ς 78), and cf. Uist. 551, extimuit tum illa, and the postpone-
ment οἱ dum in 134. cognatum suom: for the form, see 545.
Perhaps the archaisms in this verse and the last, among which we
should include the group tum iam, are designed to sound the epic

note.
131. eatenus : like hactenus, cutting short the enumeration of pre·
