Pion 58] · Aor v. somni 2. 149

si quid ayis‚· quod ayas = what you are (have) to do. Lorenz cites
Miles, 352, sed eyo hoc quod ayo id me aqere oportet. serere . . .
negotium: we still speak of ‘sowing trouble ' 3 cf. biblical ‘to sow
the wind' ; in Capt. 661, we find sator (‘ sower’) scelerum.

1101. metuculosa res = metuculosum (ξ 80) ; the word is per-
haps of Plautine coinage, a momentaneous imitation of periculosus
(5 42).

- 1102. consulere . . . tecum: your advice in settliny.

1103. This verse is spoken by Tranio in his character of Picus (see
notes on Personae) ; it institutes a play on consulere of the previous

verse in the sense of ‘ to consult an oracle ' ; sedens alludes to Picus,
the prophet-king of mythological Italy. Picus is described in the
Aeneid, vii. 187, and Ladewig's note on this passage is: “ The statue of
Picus differs from those of the kings previously mentioned in this
respect, viz. that Picus is represented in sitting posture.''
1105. contra : face to sace. aspexi : in the tone of accubas, 368.
1106. intercedat: if we render by intervene, the local sense pre-

ponderates, and if by mediate, the legal. tertius: testie, arbiter. ·

This passage sheds confirmatory light on the certain etymology pro-
posed by Professor V. Henry for testis, i.e. ‘the third (bystander).'

1107. nil quaesitit no pickinqs,· on the form, see 545. Notice
how artfully quaesiti in the mouth of Tranio takes us back to the
telling use of the word in description of Tranio in 984 (see note).
ita ε see note on 56. mali: see note on malum, 1078.

1109. med emunxti: the importance of the nose as a sense is
shown by the word nasutas, ‘ sagacious.' Horace (Sat. i. 4. 8) de-
scribes Lucilius as emunctae naris ,· counter to him stands the iuvenis
naris obesae in Epode, xii. 3 ; in Sat. i. 3. 29-30, minus aptus acutis Ι
naribus horum hominum is a reminder that others may ‘nose out‘
our own record. The sense of smell is, os all our senses, most liable
to obstructions‚ and the Greeks used ἀπομύσσει, ‘ blows the nose,’ meta-
phorically for ⁴ sharpens the wits,' and this is the sense of Horace, Sat.
i. 4. 8, just cited. Deprived of metaphor‚ me emunyere means ‘to
bring me to my senses,’ with the connotation ‘l've been making a sool
of myself,’ and with the further connotation ⁴ you've been playing on
my folly.' We may imitate the phrase by the words, ‘ you’ve been mak-
ing me drivel ' (cf. Greek κόρυζα, ‘snivel,' whence ‘ drivel‚ nonsense’).
satine recte : is the process quite complete ? num mucci fluent:
cf. Epid. 494, qm· me emunxisti mucidum minumi preti.
