ACT Ι. SCENE 3.-VERSES 157-312.

(1) Tim Cninicmns. — In this scene two new characters are
introduced, Philematium, the amica of Philolaches (see 23), and her
somewhat elderly tire-woman, Scapha, who is part serving-maid and
part duenna. Both these characters have tell-tale names (see notes on
the Personae). The amica of Graeco-Roman comedy——and probably
of Greek and Roman society —— does not occupy the moral position of
her sister, the fallen woman of modern society. She was not a social
outcast. On the other hand, a character like Camille on our modern
stage is too exaggeratedly noble to correspond with the amica of the
Graeco-Roman comedy. In our play, Philematium, who, it must be
confessed, is above the level of her class, neither says nor does a thing
that is not commendable. With Philematium we may compare
Horace's Phyllis, who was also lucro aversa (Odes, ΙΙ. 4. 19). The
moral level of the following scene between the two women is kept at
least as high as between Marguerite and her widow confidante in the
opera or drama of Faust‚· and indeed there may be said to be a
general family likeness between the two pairs of women. There is at
least one mute servant in the scene.

(2) Simorum—This scene continues the exhibition of the state
of affairs narrated by Grumio in the first scene. The conversation
between the two women reveals that one of them has been bought by
Philolaches and set free, and that in return she gives him her entire
devotion. For this she is chidden by the older woman, who, on the
ground of personal experience, prophesies that a time will come when
her young mistress will be forsaken. Accordingly she cautious her
not to give herself unreservedly to her one lover, but rather “to make
hay while the sun shines.” The conversation of the two women is
overheard by Philolaches, who, from his stage concealment‚ interjects
many an aside. He does not reveal himself till near the end of the
scene (293), when the two lovers begin to make their preparatione for
a banquet.
