94 NOTES. [Pron 14

bonus est odor ex re Ι qualibet ,· Suetonius, Vesp. 23, reprehendenti
Tito filio, quod eciam urinae vectiyal commentus esset, pecuniam ex
prima pensione admovit ad nares, sciscitans num odore offenderetur:
curiously repeated in the story of the hide-and-tallow chandler who
said, by way of excusing his employment, “Yes, it's a mighty stink-
ing business, but mighty sweet money.''

269. ne: perhaps throws back to exterye for its dependence, but
more probably introduces a prohibition. usquam : has the value of
a case form ; see ξ 50. 1.

270. uideor uidisse: this repetition (see ξ 79. 6) recurs in 8205
cf. Cicero, ad Fam. iv. 4. 3, ut uiderer uidere. alteras: on any
other occasion ‚· a pronominal adverb (see ἓ 41. 5).

271. malae : the saucy Jade ,· see note on scelesta, 170.

272. etiamne: in this question etiam probably has its usual force
of also, but see ξ 73. 1. 3. unguendam: sc. me (5 72. 1) ; Greek per-
fumes were generally put up as pomades. minume : defined in 591.

273. mulier recte olet, etc. : this sententia had an extraordinary
vitality; it was echoed by Cicero, ad Act. ii. 1. 1, ut mulieres ideo
bene olere quia nihil olebant uidebantur. Cf. also Martial, vi. 55. 5,
malo quam bene olere nil olere ; ib. ii. 12. 4, non bene olet qui bene
semper olet (this last cited by Jerome, Ep. 130. 19, and echoed by
Ausonius, E'pz‘yr. 125). Cicero's good taste in smells is also attested
by Pliny's citation (N. H. xvii. 5. 3. 38), meliora unquenta sunt quae
terram quam quae crocum sapiunt. Scapha's speech beginning here
has a sort of echo in Horace's 12th Epode.

274. istae: contemptuous here (see ξ 48. 1), though addressed to
an indefinite second person ; cf. 356 below, and Men. 438, non tu istas
meretrices mouisti, ere Ρ Amph. 287, ubi sunt isti scortatores 5³
suetae . . . interpoles: the habitual daubers; the implication with
suetae is better attested for consuetus (see the lexica). unguenti·
unctitant: pleonastic (ἓ 79. 4).

275. uetulae edentulaez old and mumblinq‚· etymologically
edentulus means ‘toothless,’ but the other occurrences of the word in
Plautus (Poen. 700 ; Men. 864, C‘as. 550) seem to fix the connotation
as (⁶01d’)‚ ‘mellow,’ ‘musty' (oswine), whence ‘stinking’ (a goat,
a lion), and so we might render here. quae . . . occuluntz defin-
ing interpoles. uitia: blemishes.

277. quasi: in Plautus often with the reduced sense of as, like.
una . . . confudit: has mixed together. iura: sauces; with a
