· 85. recordatus: final s does not make position (see §9. 4, and

ct. pectus in 86).

86. in pectus . . . institui : I ’ve put before my mind.

87. atque: postponed (see § 78). siet quod mihi cor: if 1
have α mind ‚· with the na‘ivece of this expression, the sole relies in
four maudlin lines where the one idea, ‘ Ι have bethought myself,'—-
perhaps under constraint of the musical score‚ —is spread out thiu, we
might compare the following from the opera of Billee Tayzor .· “ I'm
a villain of the deepest dye Ι Or rather I would like to be.” On 8586:
si est, see ἓ 37. 3.

88. eam rem = id (see ξ 80, and cf. quoius rei in 89). uolutaui :
frequentative (see ξ 39). et: note the variety of the preceding
copulatives‚ et . . . que . . . atque . . ., and see § 3. d.

89 a. hominem: note the prolepsis (ἓ 77).

89 b. arbitrarer: almost otiose (see ξ 74. 4) ; an indirect delibera-
tive question = what I am to think. simulacrumque habere:
adds little but verbiage to similem esse (see ἓξ 3. e, 81).

90. exemplum: similitude, parable.

91. nouarum aedium: Plautus construes similis with the genitive
only, whether of things or of persons. arbitro : for the form, see
ξ 52.

92. ei rei: the adnominal dative (see 562. 3) ; cf. aryumenta . . .
ad hanc rem, 99.

93. For the conditional coordination with the next verse, see ξ 74.
1 ; with atque here we may compare English ‘an (d)' in Μυσὴ Ado, Ι. i.
80, “an he were, I would burn my study,'' in contrast with Teumesi,
11. ii. 120, “these be fine things, an is they be not sprites.’' ueri
simile: a nearly fixed collocation of words, surviving or rather re-
vived in Italian verisimile, French vraisemblable.

94. id . . . esse: construe with credatis, faciam . . . ut cre-
datis: cf.sacite . . . uc redeat, 78.

95. This and the next three verses add little to 94 (see §81).
protecto: ay. uera : crath ,· cf. the singular in 181.
