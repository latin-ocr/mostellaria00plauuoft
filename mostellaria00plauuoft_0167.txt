ACT 111. SOENE 2. -VERSES 532-689.

(1) Tun Carmine-runs. —The only new character introduced is the
usurer (Danista), who approaehes at this juncture to dun Tranio for

“ his bill.

 

(2) Suos anmssss Am> Srnorffls. —Soon after the entrance of
the danista, Theopropides is seen returning. In the brief period since
his last exit he had fallen in, past all expectation‚ with the seller of
the house, who denied, naturally enough, the whole story of the
murder. Tranio, iu the middle of the stage, now has one foe to the
right and one to the left, and his task is, if possible, to keep them
apart. This he does for a pretty long time, at a considerable strain,
we must feel, of the sincerity of the dramatic situation. Finally‚ when
they do come together, and it is no longer possible to conceal that
Philolaches owes money to the usurer, Tranio invents ruse number
two, to the effect that when the ghost drove them out of the old house
they had horrowed money to secure an option· on a new one. He is
put into immediate embarrassment by his master's asking where the
ne'w house was. Here he jumps from the frying pan into the fire by
pointing to the neighboring house, for his master at once makes plans
for an immediate examination of his new property.

(3) Murum. —Diverbium ς 12; Iambic Senarii, ἐξ 13-14.

’ 532. scelestiorem . . . annum: worse times. argento faenori:
sc. locato (cf. 535) = investmencs ‚· for the case of faenori, see § 64. 3.
Doubtless in the professional cant (‘shop') of the usurer, amentum
faenori was no more felt as an ellipsis than such mercantile phrases
as ⁴ sight draft' or ‘ call loan ’ with us.

533. quam . . . optigit: a sort of shorthand for quam hic est
annus qui mihi optigit.

534. mani: classical miine. in toro: on ‘ the street,' on ἐπῆρε.

536. in perpetuom modum : everlastinqu.

538. qui: alternating with quo in the same verse ; cf. ξ 3. a, and
715 ff.
