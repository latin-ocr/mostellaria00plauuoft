5'3] PLAUTUS: THE MAN AND THE 'WRITER ix

Greeks (ξ 38), in common with the speech of the vulgar,
he makes great use of frequentatives (ξ 39), even where
simple verbs might seem more in place3 and a scanter use
of diminutives (ἓ 40), with their varying notes of tender—
ness and depreciation. The words we pronounce archaic in

Plautus, or a few of them at least, were, if we may infer from
sundry hints dropped here and there (see note on 1041>‚1

archaic to Plautus himself perhaps. Certainly he employed
archaic forms (see note on 120 and 121) alongside of the
standard forms current in his day, while he shows a ten-
dency to restrict such archaic forms to those parts of his
verses which were metrically the least free (see note on
danunt, 129, and, 011 the infinitives in aler, cf. Δἓ 57).

b. How far Plautus was an innovator (ξ 42) in language
we are unable to pronounce‚ inasmuch as there is no extant

. Latin of wide range of diction earlier than the plays of
Plautus, and without a knowledge of his Greek originals we f

cannot declare that many of his compounds and other free
word-formationS, apparently alien to Subsequent authorS‚
were not translations and imitations of the original Greek,
and in so far a violation of good Latinity.

c. The dialect of Plautus (§§ 33-58) was doubtless, in
most respects, not even excepting his freedom in the use of
the singular and plural (ξ 59), the 'ordinary colloquial speech
of the cultivated in his day, and we dare not infer for his
syntactical usage (ἓξ 59-73) any great amount of individual
innovation.

d. From the study of Plautus we gain our best acquaint-
ance with colloquial Latin. Hardly any of the severe regu-
larity of classic prose can be found in the structure of his
