xl INTRODUCTION. [ξ 67

The reason for the subjunctive in such cases does not lie in the protest
or reJ'ection, for the indicative is also used to indicate protest, e.g. 940:
ad ce quod nil attinet? z: nil ad me attinet?; Aulularia, 759, quod
surripuisti meum.. . :z surripio eqo tuom?‚· Curculio, 568, uapu-
lare eqo te uehementer iubeo. . . :2 mihin malum minitare? :z non
minitabor sed dabo: z leno minitatur milzia- Menaechmi, 645, palla
mihist domo surrupta: ε palla surruptast mihi?

This subjunctive seems rather to be due to a notion of indirect dis·
course, partial obliquity, as cases like the following, preceded by a
verb of saying, hint, e.g. Asinaria, 812-815 :—

ain tzc?—ap2cd amicam munus adulescentuli
fungare, uxori excuses te et dicas senem?
praeripias scortum amanti atque arqentum obicias
lenae? suppiles clam domi uxorem cuam?

and cf. below, 183 :—
quid ais sclesta ? quo modo adiurasll fe* ita eqo istam amarem.

The negative of this type of question is non (cf. 209, below, and Mile-8,
317, cited above under b), which really belongs to the suppressed verb of
saying (forbidding): thuS, cur non curem=dissuade3, uela-s me curare?

(4) In an example like 1074, ille ueniat uelim, uelim, 6 Ι would wish,'
hasbeen changed from uolo,- ‘ I wish,’ by the attraction from sensetoform.
The original type remains, e.g. in leno amentum uolo accipiat (Pseu-
dolus, 1122). This use of uelim for uolo was extended to other types
of sentence (218), and gave rise to the 66 potential '' uses of the verbs of
wishing.

68. Semi-independens clauses. — Though a phrase like ille
ueniat. uelim probably originated in the coordinate stage of Latin con-
struction, ‘ may he come: (so) I wish '3 yet used as it was side by side
with the fuller type of uelim uc petas (632), ‘I wish that you would
ask, ' we are not sure but that the Romans felt an ellipsis like our own in
‘ I wish (that) you would come.' Further examples are sine adueniat,
‘let him come’ (11), and saxo-adserat, ‘ I’ll have him bring' (68) 3
uisne . . . amplectar-e, ‘ will you . . . embrace Ρ (322).

69. Dependent clauses. — (1) The type represented by 396 (see
note), potin ut animo sis quieto is generally explained as elliptical
(z potestne fieri ul, ete), but here, too, semi independence might be
assumed: ‘ be quiet, can't you ἶ) ’
