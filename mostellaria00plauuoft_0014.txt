sentences: in Plautus, coordination (ᾗ 74) in its many typeS,
and not subordination, is the rule. Contrariwise, subordi-
nated and otiose verbs of saying or thinking (ἓ 74. 4), as well
as other instances of colloquial verbosity (ξ 79), constitute
a mark of his style. He ranges between polysyndeton and
asyndeton in various admixtures (see note on 88, and ξ 75),
and further breaks monotony by failing to observe the nor-
mal balance of structure (§ 76).

e. Plautus arranges his words into sentences with great
freedom, and especial attention may be accorded to his use
of prolepsiS, and to certain cases of postponement (ἓ 78).
If he appears thus to seek variety, yet he gets the effect of
emphasiS,—-at the risk of losing it altogether‚—-by pleo-

to be charged up to the individua] account of Plautus. Nor
is the exaggerated cant of the camp, the sea, or the polit-
ical arena (ξ 85). In all literatures Comedy is, perhaPS,
our greatest single source and storehouse of the homely
wisdom of proverbs (ἕ 86); Comedy sparkles with quips
and puns (ἓ 87), with the word of abuse or endearment
