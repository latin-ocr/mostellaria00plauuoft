132 No'rES. [Pion 41

note on this passage makes it clear (but see Leo's note) that the
Romans called the Carthaginians pultisaqi (cf. Poen. 54).

.829-830. arte: snuq, but, by equivoque‚ arte -- per meam artem.
dormiunt: sleep‚· a slip of the tongue for coniuent, which most
frequently means 6 sleep,' but also ‘ to close together '3 so in the Latin
glosses com’uoli = concordes, coniuncti, iuncti. In Richard ΙΙΙ.,
V. iii. 116, Shakespeare reverses the metaphor, “Ere Ι let sall the
windows of mine eyes.’' Such purposed tongue-slips are common
in Plautus, eg. Miles, 818, has sorbet, 6 gulps‚’ for stertit, ‘snores'3
Pseud. 841, dimissis pedibus for d. manibus ; Rud. 423, subuolturium
for subaquilum. Here, however, Tranio has in mind the two drowsy
old men as subject of dormiunt and coniuent, and nearly betrays
his covert meaning.

831. ut quicquid magis contemplor: a blend of ut maqis con-
templor and quicquid contemplor. In this and. similar locutions quic-
quid approximates quicque, whence a sporadic confusion between these
words arises.

832. cornix: i.e. Tranio (cf. 834); the pica (see note on 827)
belongs to the cornico species. uolturios: i.e. the two old men (cf.
838); ‘vulture’ (cormorant) is a conventional epithet for the fathers
and old men oi Graeco-Roman comedy, and here, aside from the
equivoque‚ not particularly applicable‚ save in so far as Theopropides
has already shown himself a greedy bargainer.

833. uideor: sc. uidere ,· cf. 270, 820, and Cicero, Lael. 41.

834. uellicat: for the form, see ξ 40.

836. illic: echoes the previous huc (cf. ς 50. 1). intuor: on
the form, see ξ 53.

838. si: here with the subjunctive of indirect question (cf. ς 66. 2).

839. omnino . . . absoluam: to have done with you sor ‚qood
and all.

840. mitto, ignosco: I ’ll lei up, I 'll excuse you. aetate:
propter aetatem. non quis: cf. nequis (837) and see ξ 3. a.

842. latius . . . misse: explained in § 71. 4; cf. Mero. 909,

seruata res esi demum, si illam uidero ,· take lacius with iuisse, and
note their metrical polarity.

843. puero : see note on 307.

845. perductorem: a iaker-in, playing on the bad sense of cir-
cumduce and duciarem.

846. perductet ε see note on 229.
