for ciuilis. trium nummum: two-bits in our Southern dialect '

has about the right tone of depreciation (ς 4); cf. 958 below. sub
falas=sub turris ambulatorius, movable attackinq shecls; the ma-
noeuvre described is a sortie, and Tranio is calling for volunteers to
execute this dangerous movement, thus foreshadowing perhaps the
ruse by which his old master is made, as it were, to besiege the house.

358. aliqui: voue‚· on the case, see 562. 4, and cf. Amph. 251,
uortentibus Telobois (rather dative than ablative absolute) telis com-
plebantur corpora. uel denis: cf. True. 373, dan (= dasne)
saulum ? : ε immo uel decem ‚· denis is a round number3 the distribu-
tive with aliquis as the indefinite ⁴ one ’ may be justified by noting the
cases of aliquis with a plural imperative (cf. Lewis and short, Lat.
Dict. sv. aliquis I. Η.). ’

359. The force of meam uicem is still felt; note the closing
alliteration.

360. offigantur bis: be double· nailed. brachia. · for the quan-
tity, see §9. 4.

361. argentum praesentarium. caslt down cf. Pseud. 302, prae

. sentes minae

362. ego sumne . . . qui: a fairly common formula, elsewhere
in the order sumne eqo. ille infelix: here ille means ‘the prover-
bial‚’ §48 13 cf. Persa, 594, eyo ille doctus leno paene ιή, foueam
decidi ‚· Terence, Adelph. 866, eqo ille aqrestis, saeuos, etc. Without
a defining noun we have ille opulentissumus (Trin. 493) = Croesus ;
so Juvenal (x. 10) uses uiribus ille Ι confisus of Milo the Crotoniat;
and Cicero (Mur. 60) alludes to Achilles in the words illi fortissimo
uiro. This use of ille often becomes slightly contemptuous =
‘the notorious, ' but frequently means ‘the famous,' e.g. ille rex
Philippus (Aul. 704), ille proynatus Theti (Epicl. 35); and ille Iuppiter
(398, below), passim. Was there a provelbial infelix? That there

. was seems to be proved by the Greek proverb (v. Leutsch‘ s Comus

Paroe‘mioqr. (Jvaec. vol. Ι. p. 438), οἴκοι γενοίμην, etc„ ‘would Iwere
at home ι’ —said of those that pray to escape missortunes,—and very
pertinent to Tranio's present condition; cf. also ibid. p. 292, οἴκοι
μένειν δεῖ τὸν καλῶς εὐδαίμονα, ⁴ the happy man iS a stay-at-home.’ Ille,
taken here as a pyrrhic (ξ 9. 2), shortens in· by §6. 2. curro cur-
riculo: run post-haste, trot,· cf. our phrases, ‘travel post,’ ‘drive
tandem'3 for the construction of curriculo, see ξ 64. 2, and for the
pleonasm‚ ἓ 79. 4.
