allowed for monosyllabis, and claimed for other, interjections and
ejaculatory phrases. Also to be noted is hiatus in enumerations (151-
153, if read according to § 31. 2), and in repetitions (id, 625).

In this text the quantity of vowels in hiatus is indicated.

2. METRE.

11. A play of Plautus bears a rather greater likeness to an
opera of the early schools than to a drama of to-day. There
are spoken parts (Diverbium) and sung parts (Canticum), the
latter being divided into Recitative and Sonq proper. An
actor might gesticulate a song-part which a singer behind the
soenes would render.

i. The Diverbium.

12. The spoken parts of a Plautine Comedy, the dialogue
in the strictest sense, are written in Iambic senarii (verses
of six iambic feet) or, with Greek nomenclature, ’.τι-1111010111.

13. lambio 'rumetum—This 1110110 allows the greatest possible
freedom os substitutions, but the last foot is always pure. For the
pure iambus ( u L), we find its precise time-counterpart, the tribrach
(ψ (J u), in any of the first five feet. The'musical time value of the
iambus and tribrach is ss. The trochee (Ἅι, L ψ) may not be substi-
tuted sor the iambus, ι ,

The following feet in Ἀ 111110 may, with sundry limitations, be sub-
stituted for the iambus (υ L), everywhere but in the sixth foot, viz.:
the spondee (- L), the anapaest (u υ L), the dactyl (- (J υ),1 and
the proceleusmaticus (υ v <J ψ).

The following percentage table is valid2 for the Senarii of the
Mostellaria: yiz. verses 1-84 (omitting 5, 21, 38-41, 57, 63, 72, 73,
84); 409-689 (omitting 411 b, 423, 452-453, 469, 478, 495-496, 501,

 

1 Α 811088οᾱ short in all the Latin metres is always one of a pair.

² This table is based, not on the text of this edition, but rather on
Goetz and Schoell's Editio Minor. In one or two cases Leo's reading
has been preferred. In making this table, where choice between
iambic shortening *and synizesis was open (ξς 6, 7), 1 have recorded
the former only. ’ Minute fractione are not recorded.
