ς 9] VERSIFICATION xiii

The same phenomenon is found in the combination αοῑᾰριᾶεπιεα,
249, which has the worth of a polysyllable.

The operation of the iambic law is, in all the above caseS,
optional.

ii. Slurred Vowels (Synizesist, synaeresis).

’1. (1) Common words like oneus, tuus, deus, and the like (perhaps
also quattuor, = quattwor, 630), often suffer a reduction, which may
be regarded either as a case of iambic shortening (mei for mei) or of
quasi-elision between impinging vowels of the same word: examples
are mifflf, 2, 51 ; mgg‘, 37: ‘Q’ rgi, 33, 92, are further slurred into
following vowels. We may compare the dissyllabic pronunciation of
bounteous‚ plenteous‚ radiant, happier, and the like, from our current
hymns. Examples m oompound words are dierecta 8; antehac, 31.

Such slurring takes place not only through h, as in the examples
quoted, but through i (i. e. j), e. g in quoitw, 818, eiius, 975.

(2) All oompounds retain hiatus or suffer slurring at the option of
the poet.

iii. Euclitics.

8. Both monosyllabjc and dissyllabic enclitics, e.g. quidem, seem
to have had the effect of shortening the syllable before them in the
Roman speech, e.g. in (μιᾰεῐ from quamsi. In Plautus, mquidem and
siquidem (107 5) are not uncommon. Thus we may account for hic in
Plautus as a oompound of Ῑιῐ with enclitic c(e).

iv. Other Peculiarities.

9. In the versification of Plautus the following words often vary
from the quantity later established: -

(1) ille, illie, iste, istie, ipse, ecce, ecquis, witha metrical value of
-υ, are reduced to υυς oblique caseS, like illa, etc„ are read as υ-.

(2) nempe quippe: υυ <or -)·

While there is some ground for believing that ille, iste, etc„ were
pronounced 'le‚ ’8εε, or perhaps ill', ἰεῦ (cf. dic, duc for dice, deice),
if we recall that, etymologically, both groups of words are made up
of oompounds with enclitic final member, they may be explained like
ᾳαᾶεῐ (5 8). This theory will account for cases like illum (Mile-3,
