ii. Involving Semivowels.

35. For both u (U) and v (V) we find only u (V). There is no
express symbol for j, but either i or ii is used, eg. peiius (710), etc.
In nunciam (from num ÷ ce -Ι- iam, rather than from nunc -4- iam),

i is a vowel.
iii. Involving Vowels.

36. We find 1) uo for uu( and vu, e.g. ruent for ruunt; quom,
seruos for quum (=cum)‚ servus; but uu for uv in uua-:uva ⁶ grape ' ε
2) uo for vein uocem (869), noster for vetem, vester ‚· and in uorco and
its compounds for verto .· 3) ol for ul in exolatum (597) z 4) u for i
before and after labial consonante, e.g. in the superlative ending -umus,
in lubet, existumo, manufesto, etc: 5) ei for ἲ, eg. in alieis (154) for
aliis: 6) e for i in aleaio (48) : 7) i for ae in deficacam (158) ; ι· for
e in enicasso (212).

iv'. Involving syllables.

37. (1) ‘syncopation' and conversely. -popli (15) for populi,
manuplares (312, 1048) for manipulares; but discipulinae (154) for
disciplinae : techinae = Greek τέχνη (550), minae = μναῖ (passim).

(2) Conuaction and its neglect.—nil = nihil, sis = si vis [cf.
audisti = audivisti, and dinus (Epidicus, 316, Miles, 675) = divinus] ;
but yraliis (175) = classical yralis.

(3) The third singular esc attaches to final vowels as -sc (eg. damna-
nost, 6) 3 also to final syllables in -m (eg. diqnissumumsi‚ 52) and -s
(e.g. natust, 89): the second singular indicative and imperative Es
attaches to final vowels (eg. luie's‚ 168), and to finals in -s, as ’s (e.g.
molentes, 955). Similar phenomena occur in English, e.g. he's, iffis,
you've.

(4) The enclitic —ne often appears as -η, and is attached to all
vowels3 it preserves the vowel of the enclitics -ce and -ie in hocin(e),
tutin(e), etc. (25) ; it submits -s to consonant assimilation and sub-
sequent disappearance in satin (= satisne), uin (= visne, 309), ain
(= aisne, 383), aperitin (= aperilisne, 445), etc.
