ACT ΙΙΙ. SCENE 3.-VERSES 690-782.

(1) CnAnAcmns. —In this scene one new character is introduced,
Simo, the owner of the neighboring house, on which Tranio had said
Philolaches already held an option. Simo represents in Graeco-Roman
comedy a very commonplace type of old man, who utters the usual
gibes 011 11011 and exacting wiveS‚ and has mild leanings to marital
truancy.

(2) SYNOPSIS.—In this scene, which begins with a long monody
of Simo's interspersed with comments aside from the listening slave,
Tranio secures permission for his master to inspect Simo's house,
on the plea that he wished to build one after the same plan for his
son.

(3) COMMENTS. —Plautus does not seem to make a good use of thie
scene for the subsequent development of the play. Tranio overhears‚
at the beginning of the scene, Simo's treasonable speeches anent his
wife, thus securing‚ by a ruse not infrequent in comedy, a hold on
Simo ; but 110 never has to make use of this hold again.

(4) Marma. -1) Verses 690-746 constitute a Canticum (ξ 20),
divided between two singers ; 2) verses 747-782 are Diverbium (ἕ 12),
and the metre is the Senarius (ἓξ 13, 14). The metrical schemes for
the Canticum are as follows :—
