96 NOTES. [Plan 15

Resolutz'on.) By popular, or perhaps genuine, etymology pulc-ra =
quae placet. nimis ornatast: Graeco-Roman comedy above all
things philosophized. The maxim μηδὲν ἄγαν (in Latin, ne quid nimis)
has the changes rung on it again in Poeni 239, nimia omnia nimium
eaeltibent neqotz' hominibus ex se.

293. diu: scanned as in 88 (cf. § 7) ; echoed from the previous
verse, diu is psychologically most apt, as a betrayal of impatience.

294. tu: addressed to Scapha. uoluptas mea: cf. 249.

295. conlubitumst : see the rendering in ξ 71. 3.

297. em: see note on 10. istuc uerbum: repeated by hoc
uerbum, as explained in ξ 48. 1. uiginti . . . decem: round num-
bers, see § 4, and cf. decem in 238.

299—300. Philolaches, as if Philematium were holding thirty minas
in trust for him, credits her with the twenty, and declares she still
owes him ten.

299. uel: belongs etymologically to uolo ‚· render here by ⁴ please,
if you will.' puta : here in the earlier mercantile sense of ‘ reckon,

300. triginta minas: over 3500 in gold, at a time when money
had greater purchasing power than now ; these words introduce a coor-
dinate causal clause (ξ 74. 3).

301. exprobrem : an echo of eaeprobras ,· for the mood, see 567. 3.
mihimet . . . opprobarier : ιο be accounted mesor 900d; this verbal
derivative of probus, ‘good‚' is a momentaneous coinage to set off
against exprobrem, derived from probrum, ‘ evil deed.'

302. usquam z alicui, as in the next verse nusquam = nemini ‚·
cf. in 535, locare . . . nemini, and see other examples of adverbs for
pronoun cases in ξ 50. 1.

303. certe . . . ponere: surely I, for chat Ι love you, my paine
on no one better could have ’scowed (see note on 138). operam
. . . ponerezoperam (col)locare; cf. Lewis and Short, Lat. Dict.
s.v. pono, I. B. 6.

304-305. In the double-entry bookkeeping of these lovers, each
enters up a credit-charge (accepti) of the other’s love (tu me amas), and
balances the credit with a corresponding debit-charge (expensi) of eqo

cc amo.
306-309. Verse 307 interrupts the continuity of sentiment in verses

300· and 308, but Philematium was aware that her lover was sentimen-
