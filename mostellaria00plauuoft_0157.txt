Plan 21] ACT 11. scENE i. 105

rule in Plautus after verbs of causing and effecting, so after curare
(Oapc. 738), promerere (Men.,1100), parare (Miles, 726).

393. quid si . . . abeamus: suppose we leave ‚· with quid si
as with quid quod the ellipsis is vague3 quid si with a subjunctive,
as here, has much the effect of a simple deliberative subjunctive.
non hoc longe: noc an inch (Sonnenschein); hoc is accusative of
extent, to be construed ultimately with abeamus ‚· for the sense of
hoc, cf. the idiom huius non sacia-m (Terence, Adelph. 163) ⁴ I shan't
care that.’ ¹

394. nam: asseverative, why, just; see note on 5. hau: for the
spelling, see § 34. 4. hau tantillo: rno whit‚· tantillo is a diminu-
tive v(§ 40).

395. ei mihi, quom: quom gives the ground of the emotion
expressed-by ei! cf. Men. 303, ei ‘mihi quom nil esc, etc. quo
eueniant: what end they will come to ‚· depends on metu (cf. note on
465). madeo metu: hardly like our ‘ drunk with joy ’A; rather z
I 'm in a cold sweac from sear.

396. potin: from either pote-ne or potisne‚· see note on 256 ; for
the construction of potin uc, see ξ 69. 1. Α phrase like this arose per-
haps from a blend of potin animo esse quieto (cf. Trin. 759) and (ut)
animo sis quieto.

398. morigerae: see note on 189. ita ille faxit Iuppiter: so
moce yreat Jove (lecree ‚· for ille, see note on 362, and for sama, ς’ 55. “

400. fac . . . occlusae sient: translated in ξ 71. 3.

402. natus nemo ι no mother's son (Sonnenschein) ; cf. 451 below
and Ru. 970.

403. responset: frequentative to respondeo ,· technical sense is
answer che door,· in Rucl. 226, responsor = ostiarius ,· cf. the simplex
in 452 and Asin. 389. quando = quom sometimes in Plautus.
hasce: cf. 404 (harunc) and see ς 48. 2. pultabit: archaic for
pulsabit ‚· in Bacch. 581 pultare echoes pulsat (579).

404. numquid aliud: in full n. a. me uis, do you want anyche‘nq

else of me? This formula, with many sub-varicties‚ is employed for

leave-taking, and is sometimes impatient, ‘are you quite done with
me ’τ’ ’ Cf. Horace, Sat. i. 9. 6.

405. foris: from che oucside (cf. ς 65. 2).

406. custodelam: Plautino for custodiam, and perhaps at first

nothing more than a momentaneous imitation (ξ 42) of its synonym
tutelam.
