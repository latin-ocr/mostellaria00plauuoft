 

Pion 5] ACT 1. SCENE 1. 73

οι· here prophetic. Render by, Oh, but the σομε will riddle you, thac's
what'll happen, I que-ss.

56. ita, etc. : introduces a reason for the epithet of the previous
verse3 see ς 74. 3.

57. eueniet . . . ut reueniat: for the construction cf. Persa,
535, neque eueniet . . . ut in luto haeream ,· also see Poen. 1170.

58. qui : for the form and signification, see ἐξ 49, 50. qui scis
an: may be rendered by perhaps, but see ξ 73. 2. istuc ε what you
say, your prophecy ‚· see ἓ 48. 1.

59. merui: note the deponent form merear, of somewhat different
signification, in 987, and see ξ 52 ; with merui supply id, and see ξ 63. 8.

60. orationis . . . iace: save· yourself the trouble of talkinq.
compendi: for case, see 5 61. 2. face: for form, see § 56.

61. te : pleonastic, see ξ 79. 2. mala re : periphrastic (see ξ 80)
for malum, ‘beating,’ a word characteristic of slaves' talk; see note
on 700, and cf. 529. Note the alliteration with m in this verse, as
often with macco (cf. Lewis and Short‚ Lac. Dict. s.v. 11. B). mac-
tari: in its literal sense; here a frequentative (see § 39) to mace,
‘ Ι beat, maul‚' but doubtless ironically allusive to its homonym macto,
of different etymological provenance, which means ‘I magnify, honor,
bless' ; compare our English euphemistic ‘ to bless,' which means ‘to
abuse, insult.'

62. eruom: for spelling, see § 36. daturin: for -n = -ne see
ἓ 37. 4.

63. dator: yenerous. To their amicae, lovers were either good
givers (oisc. 373 ; Truc. 244, 247 ; cf. C'urc. 297) or not (Asin. 165 ᾗ).
agite: for the change of number, see ξ 59. 4 ; aye and ayice are little
more than interJ'ections ; see § 89.

64. quoniam: now tham this verse and the next repeat 22-24;
see ξ 81.

65. este : for the form, see ξ 43. ecfercite : stuff. saginam:
this was stored food of any kind, but often seems specifically to mean
‘poultry·feed.' caedite: peak αι, clevour,· this rendering presup-
poses that caedite is here a translation of a specific sense of Greek
κόπτω, ⁴ 1 cut,' of which caedo is the general Latin equivalent. If this
interpretation is correct, we have here a further allusion to Tranio-
picus ‚· see notes on Personae.

66. in Piraeum: Plautus never omits the preposition with this
name (cf. ξ 65).
