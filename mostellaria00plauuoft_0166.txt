114 Norns. [Plan 27

I’ve not tripped up (for the insiders), which would seem to his master, x

should he overhear, to mean ‘I'm innocent,’ addressed to the
ghost. neque istas percussis iores : this prohibition (ς 67. 1, cf.
ς 55) continues non . . . appellabis after the brief parenthetical in-
terruption ; cf. Trin. 627, noli auersari neque te occultassis mihi.
A prohibition may, however, be loosely attached to a negative state-
ment ; cf. Bacch. 476, ipsus neque amat nec tu creduas.

517-518. Several words in these verses are lost. If the restora-
tion in Leo's text, here printed, is correct, it is clear that Tranio's
conversation with the insiders is unintelligible to his master, nor is
it improbable that in his great fright Theopropides has got pretty
far off on the stage. segreges . . . sermonem: break off the
conversation; cf. Poen. 349, sem-eya sermonem, caedem Miles, 655,
si quis ibist odiosae, abeo domum, sermonem seyre90; seqreyes is
the so-called subjunctive of protest3 cf. §67, 3, and see note on ut
resistat, 1172.

519. an quaeso, etc. : I bey yourpacmon, had you been calliny me,
— a natural English use of tenses corresponding to the Latin use here ;
the pluperfect implies an interval of inattention.

520. amabunt: on the force of the tense, see § 71. 5. mor-
tuom, etc. : Tranio’s previous communications with the insidere had
been carefully adapted for this very explanation.

521. percussisses: meant to take the master's mind back to the
situation in 453 ff., but carrying also an uncomfortable verbal sugges-
tion of the uncanny question (hicine percussit 2³) in 508.

522. etiamne astas: clo you still linyer? quae: the antece-
dent, though in a different ease (eis), is omitted ; see note on 413. ἱ

523. respexis : for the form, see ς 55. operi caput: covering
the head in time of danger was a religious act3 cf. Amph. 1093, inuo-
cat deos immortalis ul sibi auxilium serant Ι manibus puris, capite
operto‚· Livy, iv. 12. 11, records that suicides covered their heads
before drowning themselves (cf. Horace, Sal. ii. 3. 37).

525. scio: with ironical intonation. tanto opere: also found
in reversed order. See note on maxumo opere, 420. extimuerat-2
the pluperfect of a verb in -sco = the imperfect of the simplex.

526. nil . ⁴. . curassis: on nil in commands,'see ξ 91. 2, and
cf. Miles. 10073 Juvenal, iv. 22, nil tale exspectes. prouidere:
meantime (ξ 71. 6) I'll look out sor myself.

52¹7. quantum quis: cf. quantum potest (758), and see ξ 43.
