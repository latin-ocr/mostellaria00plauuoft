. Pion 19] Ac'r 11. SCENE 1. 103

363. attat: look you Ι, a cry of joy at Tranio's approach with
the marketing. opsonium ι see note on obsonate (24) for the defi·
nition, and cf. piscatum, 67. ·

364. quid est: here a cry of ‘alarm‚ not nonchalant as in 172;
cf. quid est neyotl', 458.

365. pater attatae adest: Tranio mockingly turns (see notes on
512 and 747) his young master's cry of J'oy to one of alarm, recurring
in attalae to the tragic note of ἀτταταῖ. absumpti sumus: for
the tense, see ξ 71. 2.

366. attat adest: the further repetition of this stammering phrase,
of which attatae is only a variant, but prolonged the suspense. The
comic effect of such repetitions is attested by the famous angry sen-
tence that so often recurs in Moliere's Fourberies de Scapim —the line
Rostand selects to claim for Cyrano de Bergerac (V. vi.)‚ — que diable
allait il faire dans cette yalere?

368. quid . . . ago: what am I to do? ayo is common in the
deliberative question, and passes for an indicative (§ 66. 1), but
though a (secondary) aqimus also occurs three or four times, it
may be an old subjunctive (cf. Greek ἄγω, indifferently indica-
tive or subjunctive). A considerable number of other lst singular
forms occur in this usage (ci. 774); while ayo? is found in Cicero
(Lorenz cites pro Quinct. 53 and ad Act. vii. 20. 2) and in the
Αεηείᾱ, iv. 534, en, quid ayo? rursusne procos . . . experiar?
accubas: answers ayo? as if it were a genuine question‚— ‘am
I doing) Note a quip of the same sort on quid aqis? 719; and cf.
Bacch. 1196.

369. tutin: for the form, see ἓ 37. 4.

370. It may seem hard not to render the conditional sentence here
as unreal (ξ 69. 3), but the ‘following sentence will illustrate the trans-
lation as ideal. “Now bless my soull what for would I go Ι To tell
youl1es('1*.1‹:.Brown's The Boccor, p 329). -·

371. haec: the obJ'ects mentioned in 307 6.; cf. 391. &molitiem
sc. pueros (ξ 72.1).

373. cedo ut bibam: Callidamates is the high comedian of the
scene3 this utterance (with its neat echo of 344), valeat pater (374),
i iube abire rursum (377), cedo soleas (384), and the quasi-indecency
of 386 are all full of comic possibilitieS.

374. Philolaohae: for the form, see ς 44. ualeat pater: my
qood-bys ιο his samem the subjunctive echoing vale, * good-by)
