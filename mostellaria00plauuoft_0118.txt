ACT Ι. SCENE 1.—VERSES 1-84.

The lexica and older reference books cite by act, scene, and line; a
control of these citations is afforded by the running title, which sup-
plies the numbering given by N audet's Plautus in the Lemaire collec-
tion. These act and scene numbers do not correspond with those of
the present edition.

(1) PLAN or STAGE:

st-OEb b
4? ει] Qja

abed = stage, representing a street.

1 z house of Theopropides, opening on right of rear wall. Ι

2 = house of Simo, opening on left of rear wall.

3 z door leading to the city and the adJ'acent country.

4 = door leading to the Piraeus.

5 = alley between 1 and 2.

6 = altar near the house of Simo.

The scene is laid at Athens, as in most of the comedies of Plautus
and all of Terence's. The local color and allusions are also Athenian,
or at least Greek, in the Romanized Greek comedy of these authors.
