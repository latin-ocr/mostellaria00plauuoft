68 NOTES. [Plan 3

pernicies, ‘destruction,' based on permittit, ‘gives a free hand to.’
The Century Dictionary cites s.v. permittance: this unclean permit·
tance defeats the sacred and glorious end both of the moral and
judicial law.

4. pol: yad,· a much-worn oath·form (ξ 90) of the name Pollux3
we have similar squeezes in the oaths of Elizabethan drama, e.g. By'r
Lakin, Zounds, 'S death, etc. ruri: on the farm; see note on
pistrinum, 17. si uiuam: as sure as I live, hardly different from
si uiuo (see ξ 71, 1), 1067. ulciscar probe: a qood beating (pun-
ishing) is good Latin.

5. nido : nest, hele ‚· easily said to Tranio, who was, by equivoque,
a picus (see note on Tranio’s name). nam: why! common in
Plautus immediately before interrogatives; nam may also be post-
poned, following the interrogative immediately or with an interval
(see 368), The sense ‘forst though already established by Plautus's
time for nam, was by no means so universal as it subsequently be-
came ; see also note on enim, 551.

6. quid . . . clamatiost: vigorous circumlocution for quid
clamas ‚· on -st, see ξ 37, 3. malum ι the mischief! seems here as an
expletive to admit hiatus and syllaba anceps (see ἓ 10. 6).

8. abi . . . abi: note the variety of metrical position (ς 83).
ᾱξξτθοτεε more often in the form diei-ecce (see 5 7. 2), e.g. in Bacch.
579. Nonius (49. 24) is cited for the following definition : dierecti dicti
cruci fixi, quasi ad diem erecti, and by deriving from dio- (see 765,
note)÷ erectus we may reconcile the ancient definition with modern
etymology. The fact that dierectus is always employed in connection
with verbs of motion (for quiescere, ‘to come to a stop,’ in Oapt. 636,
does not constitute an exception) has led some modern scholars to de-
fine by ‘straight, direct.' It seems best torfollow Nonius, though his
definition may be a mere popular etymology suggested by a context
like that of 850 below. This epithet is always very violent, at least
as much so as German verfluchtes or ‘ d—d' in our vernacular. It is
always applied to slaves or inferiors, if addressed to persons, but is
said of a boat (Men. 442), and of the heart (Gapc. l.c.); cf. also
Varro ap. Non. l.c.‚ apaye in dierectum α domo nostra istam insani-·
tatem. The epithet is desiderative, a condensed wish, ‘may you be
hanged' ; see note on 1, mastiqz‘a. ⁴
