5. STYLIS'mc.

74. Co'drfflnation. —The language of Plautus is colloquial, aud
popular speech stringe its sentences loosely together.

The demonstrative will take the place of the relative, and often
clauses, as well as words, are left without any connective. Thus the
grammatical relation of clauses fails to correspond with their logical
relation, and it is not always easy precisely to inser the logical
relation.

facere dixerunt.
